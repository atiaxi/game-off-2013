# The Afterlife Had Wood Paneling

What happens after you die?  Simple - your implanted soulkeeper uploads you to
a virtual world designed to simulate your brain so you can continue living. 
(After)life in New Detroit is certainly no paradise, but it beats the
alternative, and you get to live forever.

Except now, someone's died, and unless you can find out who and how, anyone
could be next.
