The afterlife had wood paneling.

It'd ordinarily be an absurd thing to notice.  I was dead, after all, in the hereafter's own waiting room.  You'd think there'd be pearly gates, or at least a hint of brimstone, but instead?

It was a waiting room.  Wood paneling on the walls, an oblong receptionist counter complete with bored-looking [[receptionist]] doing her best not to make eye contact... it was only missing some out of date magazines and it'd be perfect.  I'd have to mention it to whoever ran the place.

:: receptionist
I made my way up to the receptionist.

"Sam Hallivert" I said.  "I suppose I have an appointment?"

The receptionist looked up at me as though I was barely more interesting than the game of solitaire she'd been cheating at.  "Not as such, no."  She went back to the game.

I waited for her to continue talking, and she waited for me to sit back down.  She had the advantage of long hours' practice at ignoring waiting rooms, but I was dead.  It wasn't as though I had anywhere else to be.

She looked back up.  "Mr. Guillory will see you as soon as he is available.  Please wait your turn."

I glanced back at the row of four seats that apparently sufficed as a waiting room.  Without me there to provide bulk, they were empty.  I opened my mouth to-

"He's with a client."  the receptionist said before I could even turn my head back.

I nodded.  She'd won this round.<<set $guilloryPhone="Test">>

:: intro_wait
I was expecting the seats to either be uncomfortably thin or absurdly over-stuffed, in the style of waiting room seats everywhere.  These looked thin but didn't feel it.  They didn't feel like much of anything, to be honest.  I could have been sitting on a box and leaning against the wall and gotten more of a sensory experience out of it.

That I was reduced to mentally critiquing the furniture indicated a lot about my [[mental state|intro_mentalstate]].

* [[Wait|intro_invite_in]]


:: intro_mentalstate
Some part of me kept insisting that I ought to be panicking right now.  I was dead, killed in the prime of my life by...  well, I couldn't remember how I died precisely, but I didn't really feel like knowing the grisly details of my demise at the moment anyway.

The point was, I was dead and I ought to be upset by it, but I couldn't find it within myself to really care that hard.  Obviously, there was an afterlife - I was in it.  The fact that it lacked a certain polish was a minor detail.

:: power_of_two_exterior
"The Power of Two" sounded like it ought to be a bordello, and as I got closer to the building I could tell that this impression was, if anything, understated.

Posters of naked women covered every available surface of the building, in many cases obscuring each other and in some places overlapping with the neon sign naming the building.  A very few ordinary signs were visible:  One proclaiming "Titanic Tits!" and another in much smaller type explaining that the cover charge to enter was 1 day.
<<if $tourInProgress>>
Samahd gestured to the display and wiggled his eyebrows suggestively.  "I'm not here to judge!".

Grinning, he donned his tour-guide voice.  "This, as you've probably guessed, is New Detroit's premiere whorehouse.  Athena - that's the AI that runs this sim - doesn't let people just turn their brain's pleasure center on and ignore the world, so sex is still very much a thing!  It's got some benefits over the real thing.  No diseases, nobody can possibly get pregnant, nobody's forced into it because you can't be forced into anything here - it's pretty much the best brothel ever, anywhere."

He shrugs.  "That's the official line, anyway.  It's kinda pricey for my taste.  Head up this way and I'll show you my hangout."

The door finally opened, and a bespectacled man in his early forties stepped out, holding a manilla folder.  Wherever I was, it was decidedly low-tech.

"Sam Hallivert?" he said, looking up and meeting my gaze.  He at least had the dignity to look slightly embarassed at asking a question with an obivous answer. "Ah.  Right this way, if you would."

* [[Follow him|intro_guillory]]


:: intro_guillory
What choice did I have?  As strangely at-peace as I was with my current morbid state of affairs, I still had questions. "Alex", as his gilded nametag proclaimed him to be, presumably had answers.

He turned back through the door, and I followed.

I'd been expecting a doctor's office - as much or as little as that made sense for a dead man - but what I got instead was "insurance agent".

<html><div class="center">
Alex Guillory<br/>

</div></html>

I frowned at the desk plaque as Alex moved behind it and took his seat.  Insurance?  It was naggingly familiar and utterly bewildering at the same time.

If Guillory noticed my reaction, he didn't say anything.  Instead, he gestured toward the seat behind me - identical to those in the waiting room, so far as I could tell - and said "Mr. Hallivert, please, have a seat."

Guillory looked at me for a moment, then back at his folder.  Finally, shaking his head as though to clear it, he took a pen and made some note I couldn't see from my vantage point.  "My apologies, Ms. Hallivert, there was a mistake in our files.  Please take a seat."

Guillory launched into what I could tell was a well-recited speech.

I frowned.  "I'd prefer not to."  I said in a very specific mild tone.  Specifically, that mild tone of voice used to imply that one has a wide variety of more persuasive methods should mild tones not work.

Guillory was either unfamiliar with the tone or completely unimpressed by it.  "I can imagine so, but it really is to help you."

* [[Answer the questions|intro_question_1]]
* [[-- No, you answer my questions|intro_interrupt_2]]

I nodded, supressing a weary laugh.  "Yeah.  I'm dead."

Guillory put down the pen and nodded, seemingly relieved.  "Ah, yes, that is the case.  I am glad that you've already realized it - many people, even after being briefed, take quite a while to come to that conclusion."

He paused for a moment, smiling, but then suddenly seemed to remember he had work to do.  "Are you ready for the next question?"

* [[You're ready for the next question|intro_question_2]]

I did my most convincing I-don't-know-nothing shrug.  "You tell me."

Guillory made a note in the folder.  "Ah, I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news then.  I'm afraid you've died."  He followed this up immediately, as though afraid I was about to erupt in emotion.  "There's nothing to be worried about, you're fine now!  As I'll explain, you have a new life now with us, and it's every bit as full of potential as your last."

He studied me for a few moments.  "May I ask you another question?"

:: insurance_exterior
I stood in front of the Life Preservers Insurance building - a middling grey cube in the sea of middling grey cubes that apparently made up this place.  It was dark - and I very quickly got the impression that it was always dark - but surprisingly quiet for a modern city.  No horns blared, nobody yelled from the window of their car.  There didn't appear to be any traffic whatsoever, that I noticed.  A few people trudged by now and then, silent in their contemplation or more likely spending all their mental energy on gathering the willpower necessary to take another step.

:: bar_ocho_exterior
Bar Ocho looks like someone took the platonic ideal of 'Bar' and copy-pasted it into the city.  Considering the fact that this was a simulated city, that might not have been too far from the truth.  The name of the bar was in neon, as far too many building signs seemed to be.  The "O" in "Ocho" was overlaying a large stylized 8-ball.  I found myself wondering if anyone played pool in New Detroit.

<<if $tourInProgress>>
Samahd stood to the side of the bar's door.  "For future reference, this is where I am on almost all of my downtime.  I mean, I'll give you my card at the end of the tour, but not everything is business, right?  Sometimes you need to unwind.  That's what this place is for!  The beer's not as effective as on the outside, but the upside is that you can't become addicted to it.  Simulation doesn't allow it.  Great, huh?"

He gestured up to the non-buzzing neon sign.  "Oh, another thing.  See that sign?  That's a pun in my language.  'Borracho' means 'drunk'.  Despite the America-centric theme of the city names, there are more languages spoken here than in any other one place on earth.  Turns out translation is only hard for computers when they don't have full access to the mind-state of the people doing the talking.  So if you never got to learn another language in your previous life, don't worry!  You'll never need to!"

He stepped away from the door and started walking up the street, pointing to a large vertical column in the distance.  The slightly glowing blue cylinder was far taller than any other building - or anything I'd ever seen in either life.  "That thing is our next stop."

I shrugged.  I'd gathered I was dead, that the afterlife was poorly decorated, and that angels (or devils, the state of my soul was still up in the air) had names like "Alex Guillory".  Everything else was news to me.

Alex made a note in my file and nodded.  "Memory can take a while to be re-accessible."  He closed the folder and looked up at me.  "Well, I have answers."

He gestured around himself, indicating that I should take in the room.  There wasn't much to see - the same faux-wood paneling on the walls, an uninspired plastic desk, the job plaque I'd noted earlier, a cup of pens.

I'd been a private investigator in my previous life, though, so I also noticed what wasn't in the room.

Guillory's desk only had his plaque, the pens, and the manilla folder.  There were no ports to plug anything into, and no ports for output.  The holographic projection interface you'd need if you wanted to use the desk for anything other than putting things on was conspicuously absent.  The desk was either a great deal less advanced than the desks I was familiar with, or a great deal more.

Now that I was thinking about plugs, ports, and electronics I noticed more:  There were no electronics at all, and the corresponding places where they'd interface were also missing.  No charging stations.  There wasn't even a light switch and, now that I was looking, no /light/.

I frowned at the last observation.  The room was lit perfectly - there weren't even shadows.  I'd say it was impossible but I'd already done one impossible thing today just by being here.

:: ferro_tour_accept
<<set $money = $money - 7>><<set $tourInProgress = 1>><<set $ferroInPerson=1>>I looked through my wallet and discovered I had exact change.  Hoping this worked like it did in the real world, I took seven days worth of bills out and handed it over to Samahd.  He smiled and took it, so I must have done something right.

"All right, let's get started!  Let's see, basic information you need to know:  This is New Detroit, the lowest level of the simulation.  You've probably noticed all the lack of amenities - no shadows, no smells, no heat or cold, sounds don't travel far, lots of things lack texture - you get used to it.  You probably wouldn't even have noticed if I hadn't pointed them out." He grinned prankishly and started numbering things on his hand.

"First, you can't die here."  There was something in the tone of his voice when he said this, but as usual I couldn't get him to stop long enough to ask.  "Where would you go, right?  Second, you can't be hurt here unless you go into the wrong neighborhood - and you'll know it if that happens.  Third, you can't be robbed - other people can't even //see// your wallet, let alone take anything out of it.  This Detroit's a lot safer than the real one, if a lot less scenic."

"Fourth:  Don't run out of time.  That's a one-way ticket to Storage.  I'd recommend getting a job - even one that pays one day per day is a pretty good gig, keeps you going."

Samahd looked down at his hands as though he'd forgotten something, then shook his head to dismiss it.  "Anyway, enough about the new motor city in general, let's get specific."

He smiled his tour-guide smile and gestured to the Insurance building behind us.  "This, as you're probably already aware, is the Life Preservers Insurance building.  Drop-off point for new uploads fresh off the bus.  They've got customer service agents always ready to talk, they sometimes help with job placement if you're willing to pay for it.  Kinda self-defeating if you ask me, but hey, whatever works."

"Up this way is the Power of Two."  Samahd started walking up the street.

:: intro_bridge
"This place is no insurance agency, that's for sure."  I said, gesturing to his plaque.

Guillory chuckled.  "Actually, we are."  Opening the folder again, he pulled out a rather large bundle of paper, stapled together.  I hadn't remembered the folder holding that much, but I didn't get the chance to ask before Guillory turned the paper to face me and put it down on the desk.  "This is your policy."

I wanted to ask Guillory for clarification, but I had the feeling the policy would speak for itself.  Unsurprisingly, it was by the same naggingly familiar "Life Preservers Insurance" and seemed to be pretty standard legalese.  I was about to give up and simply demand an answer when a portion caught my eye.

:: koloman_storage [conversation nocall]
"Oh, no, you misunderstand, she was not a criminal or anything."  Koloman explained.

"I thought storage was a one-way street."  I replied neutrally.  If there was a way out of the afterlife's simulated purgatory, I didn't want to appear too eager to learn about it and scare the guy off.

"Ordinarily, yes.  These circumstances were different - the contract I'd written up for our placement into the simulation, it covered both of us, but only //both// of us.  We had to arrive at the same time.

A slow frown came over his face.  "I anticipated that I would die first.  I did not want to spend an eternity waiting in a simulated world for my daughter to join me.  It seemed... unseemly to silently hope for her death so that she might live with me again."  He scoffed.  "So the contract stated that the first to die would be placed in storage."

"And it was her."  I tried to say this as neutrally as I possibly could.  In truth, I was reeling from the fact that he'd not only lost his daughter recently, he was losing her for the second time.

"It was."  He replied quietly.  He'd slipped into the somber mood I'd noticed whenever we got on the topic of how his daughter had been in life.  "Undiscovered heart valve problem.  I spent fifteen years in the outside world, waiting for my time to come so that I might join her."

He sighed, then looked back up at me.  "When I did, when I came here, the first face I saw was hers.  She told me about her dreams in Storage, how she'd seen the simulation for what it truly was, and it was beautiful and horrible, awful in the old sense of the term, like a fire that could consume a city."

"I thought Storage was just... storage."  Once again, my newness to the situation was showing.  "You're shipped to some tape backup under a mountain or something."

"It is."  Koloman confirmed.  "Not exactly as you described, but near enough.  You cannot dream in storage, because there is no 'you' to dream!  These were earlier days of the simulation.  I worried that my Iva had been one of those afflicted by the upload.  But aside from her newfound passion for art, there were no signs."

"I hired two other investigators, but they are no longer employed by me."  Nickolai answered simply.

"There are many retired policemen in the city, but thus far only one has decided to become involved.  He is the one who moved my daughter's body to the courthouse - so far as I know, that's where he lives.  Feel free to talk to him, though he's under no obligation to answer either you or me and he is well aware of that fact."

"My daughter was an artist.  She had her professional rivals, though there were not many.  She did not seriously compete for their attention, you see.  She was independently - independent even of me - wealthy, she had no need to attract a patron as most in the community did.

"Those few who did compete with her did so out of a desire, I believe, to humble or humiliate.  They saw her as an interloper, a trust-fund dropout slumming for fun.

"I am no doubt biased in my estimation, but I do not believe this was so.  She believed genuinely that the limited palette of a place like New Detroit gave her an artistic canvas unlike anything in the real world.  Her work stood on its own."

:: koloman_suspects_nobody [conversation nocall]
"It is for the best."  Koloman sat back down just as abruptly as he'd stood up.  The manic energy that had infused him just moments before had seemingly fanished.

"So, that suspect must be for now eliminated by virtue of us being unable to investigate.  Still, that is not my only suspect."

He sighed, then smiled.  "This is one of the instances in which I am glad you are new to the system, <<print $gender>> Hallivert.  If I were to say that I suspected hackers, a more savvy citizen would laugh in my face."

I shrugged.  "Sounds like the sort of thing hackers could do."

"And indeed they could, if there were such a thing."  Koloman agreed.  "Anyone who first arrives in the simulation believes that potential hackers are everywhere.  People who would grift time from innocents, perform miracles, do the impossible.  A decade or two of experience and they realize the truth:  There are only ordinary grifters.  Miracles were pre-programmed into the simulation before it even started.  The impossible is mundane.

"Hackers now have the reputation of being a fairy tale, but I'm mentioning them for a reason.  A few months ago, my daughter got involved with their kind.  I don't mean hackers themselves, of course, but gamers.  Wannabes.  People interested in exploring the forbidden edges of the simulation.  She was looking for them because they seemed her best bet to find a real hacker, someone who could actually change the system.

"Be careful, <<print $gender>> Hallivert.  It is my fear that she found one, and it cost her her life."

"Yes."  Koloman replied bitterly.  "There are very few capable of such an action."

He stood suddenly, pacing rather than sitting still.  "This is something I have given much thought.  There is the obvious answer, yes?  Someone who I will not name, because to name the devil is to summon her."  He pointed upward briefly as he said this.  "But you know who I mean, yes?"

Guillory smiled widely.  "That's entirely up to you.  You have most of another whole life ahead of you.  Many of our clients dedicate themselves to art, or mastering a skill that they lacked in life.  Many others simply lie back and relax, treating this as an extended retirement."

He gestured down to the sheaf of paper on his desk that was my insurance policy.  "The policy you purchased in life gives you fifty years of New Detroit time - more specifically, a little over three million seconds subjectively.  Time flows a little bit differently from city to city, but nothing you'll notice unless you spend a while there, and should you be able to afford that you'll likely have more time than you need anyway."

"Afford?"  I looked at him skeptically.  There was always a catch.

"You've no doubt heard the phrase 'time is money'?  Well here it is literally true.<<set $heardTimeIsMoney=1>>  What your policy paid for is enough computing power to simulate you for fifty years at the level of fidelity that New Detroit offers.  That money on the outside became time here.  Time here is a valuable and scarce commodity that cannot be counterfeited.  Your fifty years is currency - a fair bit of it, actually.

"The process is very technical" Guillory literally handwaved the response.  At least he had the decency to almost immediately realize that I wasn't going to find that a satisfactory answer.

"Well," he began again, "your soulkeeper <<set $heardOfSoulkeeper=1>>is extracted after your death.  Its patterns are fed into the large banks of machinery that make up this world, and those computers then add your mind to its simulation."

"Simulation."  I said.  Suddenly the copy-and-paste furniture made a great deal more sense.

"Yes.  I don't know your religious leanings, <<print $gender>> Hallivert, but this is not a spiritual afterlife.  You are currently within the memory and processors of nearly five thousand top-of the line servers at a data-center in Boulder City, Nevada."

There were three exits here:  The door to Alex Guillory's office at least attempted to look more like real wood than its surroundings.  The purpose of the metal door with the "EXIT" sign above it was obvious.  A smaller half-door at the other end of the room seems to be a janitor's closet of some sort.

Koloman didn't meet my gaze, only waved dismissively.  "You now have the key.  Feel free to enter and make note of whatever you will, it is all as the police left it.  I... I haven't had the heart yet to visit and clean it out."

He sighed.  "I have much work to do once this investigation is complete."  His mood shifted suddenly, the defeated hunched-over posture becoming ramrod straight, the frown intensifying into a teeth-gritting grimace.  "Once I know the criminal's name, yes... much to do."

He pulled out a business card identical to the one I already had.  "I have added my own security protocols to this card so it will be safe for us to talk via phone.

"I am not sure what you have heard of me, <<print $gender>> Hallivert, so I will tell you myself.  I am a man who does not brook failure.  In life, I asked of my people only slightly more than they believed they could deliver, and in many cases they lived up to my expectations.

"I got what I wanted."  he elaborated.  "I did not resort to bribery or thuggery as some have alleged, but neither am I a saint.  Jobs have been lost, careers destroyed, because of the decisions I have made.  I do not regret any of it.

"You may think me a hard man, and you are correct.  But I am also a reasonable man.  I know that I am asking the impossible.  Should you fail to show any progress for a month, you will be reimbursed for that month of time and I will find another detective to take up the mantle."

"Am I the first?"  I found myself asking before wondering if it was a good idea.

"Do not speak her name."  Koloman hissed.  There was a moment when he watched me to make sure I understood while I tried not to appear as rattled as I felt.  Whatever he saw in that moment, he appeared satisfied:  He let go of me and backed away.  "For both our safety.

"The Soulkeeper is you - at least, the you that you are now."

Guillory saw my nonplussed expression.

"Well, it's a bit more technical than what I'm about to describe, but simply put, the soulkeeper contains a few hundred billion tiny machines.  These machines are very small - the term 'microscopic' is too large, to give you an idea - such that all these machines can quite easily fit within your head."

I didn't like where this was going.  Obviously I couldn't argue the end result, but the process was already sounding very uncomfortable.

The insurance agent seemed to notice my discomfort.  "It's actually quite noninvasive.  The machines are smaller than even your own brain cells.  That's their job, after all - once implanted, each device finds a nerve to latch on to.  From there, it goes about recording everything.  What causes this nerve to fire?  What levels of neurotransmitters are present at the time it does so?  When does this nerve die, and if this happens what is the cause?  Is there a replacement?"

"So they learned how to be me."  I observed.

Guillory nodded.  "Exactly!"

The question made Guillory smile.  "That's somewhat of our mission statement."

"Life Preservers Insurance," he said with the same air of rehearsed speech he'd had earlier, "was founded to provide people with policies that could be used to keep them alive in this simulation after they'd passed on.

"That is somewhat of an important point - we are not a traditional insurance company.  We do not insure houses, or health, or even life in the usual manner - though much of the funding that finances your part of the simulation is derived from a life insurance policy.  Instead, we're an insurance company dedicated to getting people to the /next/ life.  This life.

He smiled welcomingly as he caught my gaze, and had closed the gap between us before I could even say a word.

"Samahd Ferro, Tour Guide." he said.  "I've got other titles - welcome wagon, noob patrol, New Arrival Emotional Well-Being Adjuster - it's just that the 'Tour Guide' thing is the most honest.

"Anyway," he continued, not letting me get a word in edgewise, "it's my job to give new folks like yourself an overview of the area.

"You'll have an expense account - you'll be able to travel freely here in New Providence to give reports to me, and should you require anything else you may simply call and have me approve it.  This includes travel to other cities or even off-grid.

"If you provide me the name of Iva's killer and sufficient evidence, you will be rewarded with fifty years of New Amsterdam time.  That's thousands of years in New Phoenix, tens of thousands should you stay in New Detroit.  You will be set for life - lives, should you choose."

"No offense taken, it was a question I asked her many times."  His tone indicated he hadn't gotten a particularly compelling explanation himself.

"She was an artist, fascinated by the medium that is the simulation.  I don't mean that she was fascinated by working within the simulation, I mean that she found the simulation //itself// to be a medium.

"She was not the first to think so, of course, the idea of reality as a canvas pre-dates realities as mutable as this one.  And the restrictions placed on this simulation at all levels mean it is much less mutable than one would hope.  Still, she worked to express this idea through the more mundane mediums.

"Why New Detroit?  She believed it to be somehow more authentic.  New Providence is the most detailed of the simulated realities, but Iva did not find it to be //real//.  The least realistic level of the simulation was closest to the computer, and thus more resembling the reality of the fact that we are living inside a machine."

"I'm not sure I follow."  I replied.  

"Neither did I."  Nickolai did not seem the artistic sort.  "It is so strange.  Before her death - her... first death, I suppose I should say -she was an accountant, she dealt in the concrete of numbers.  She preferred it to the less definable careers, kept at it even after the advent of GAAAI meant machines could do her job better than she could."

"Not exactly."  Now that a less professional topic such as religion had come up, Guillory looked a lot less comfortable.  "This company was founded by the Preservationist movement, of course, and a fair amount of stock is still owned by the church.  But-" he held up a finger to stress the point "we don't require that our clients adopt, share, or even entertain such beliefs.

"Obviously, believing that people should be preserved after they die and working at an agency like this are quite compatible.  Similarly, those that believe in a non-digitizable soul that they will take with them to a true afterlife are unlikely to sign up for our services.  Still, we are open to all."

"Anyone who runs out of time is simply downgraded to Storage.  We're Preservers, after all<<set $heardOfPreservationists=1>>, we're not going to just delete someone."

Despite the calming tone, I didn't like the sound of Storage.

Guillory had anticipated my next question.  "Yes, Storage is what it sounds like.  Your patterns that are currently in simulation now are stored on disk - and also redundantly backed up, of course.  You will no longer be simulated, but of course it's the Preservationist belief that eventually simulation costs will be so low that everyone can be revived for free.  At that point, you'll be returned, likely to this very office."

Guillory's sole reaction was a slight raising of one of his eyebrows.  "That is a very influential person who contacted you."

"So can I trust him?"  It was the most important question.  Of course, if Koloman was as important as Guillory had just said, it was possibly I couldn't trust anyone's answer to that question.

"He strikes me as a mostly reputable businessman" was the eventual answer.  "I only have access to public records, of course, but he doesn't seem to be particularly cutthroat.  His manufacturing concerns are simply more efficient than his competitors, likely due to proprietary techniques.  Koloman Industries applied for 1500 patents last year alone."

"Thanks."  I replied.  It was probably the most I was going to get from someone who was himself answerable to a corporation.

You could walk across a busy freeway in complete safety, provided you didn't mind heading to court afterward and paying a hefty fine for disrupting traffic.

:: Untitled Passage 1



:: elevator_exterior
Every other building in New Detroit seemed to have been cut from the same block of concrete.  The Elevator was different.  A sleek blue steel column, it started from ground level and stretched upward into the sky.  I couldn't tell where - if anywhere - it stopped.
<<if $cardKoloman>>

"Yeah."  Samahd nodded.  "That's the Elevator, it's how you get to other cities in the same simulation.  It could have been an airport or something, but I think the people who designed it liked the Elevator metaphor.  They're above us that way."

He turned back to me.  "Like I said at the beginning, this sim's workable but missing some amenities.  Nothing here takes your breath away, right?"

I knew he used that phrase on purpose, because I noticed then that I wasn't breathing.  I hadn't been breathing the entire time.  I didn't think I //could// breathe and, most strange of all, this fact did not trigger a panicked choking for survival.

"Yeah, this stage of the sim, the city we call New Detroit, it's just above the brain-in-a-jar level.  You get most of your brain simulated but almost none of your internal organs.  Cuts down on the overhead of the sim, you can fit more people in cheaply.

"Ever have a dream that, when you wake up, you realize was utterly absurd?" Again, without waiting for an answer, he continued, "Why didn't you realize it in the dream?  I mean, four-armed gorilla monsters from space aren't even remotely real, but your dream-self doesn't question it.  It's the same thing here.  There's a part of your brain dedicated to constantly asking the question 'does this make any damn sense at all?'.  In dreams, it's shut off.  Here?  It's not even simulated."

He gestured back to the column.  "That's not the case everywhere.  The next city up is New Phoenix.  They've got shadows, better physics, more texture, better sound, but still no internals.  It's the same sim, keep in mind that this isn't taking you off-grid or anything, it's just that they dedicate a lot more computing power to NPX.  It costs a lot more too, though - the ratio of New Detroit time to New Phoenix time is about 50:1.  One day's vacation would cost you a couple months.  That scale's just about the same all the way up, too.  Next city's New Amsterdam, and that's fifty times more expensive than New Phoenix.  Top of the pack is New Providence.  It's fifty times more expensive than NA.  I don't know if you've done the math, but that means you could spend a lifetime in a few minutes."

He shook his head.  "Too rich for our blood, in other words.  Come on, let me show you the courthouse."

The guard must have been part-time, as he was nowhere to be seen.  I didn't miss him.

<<set $nftNpr=1>>New Providence took my breath away.  It did this by first giving me the ability to breathe.  Air, real air, filled my lungs as I inhaled for the first time since I'd died.  And then I saw the scenery.

It was a cool autumn afternoon - a setting sun threw intricate shadows through the thinning trees.  Colorful leaves dominated the landscape except for the lone road leading from the elevator, and even that had a few stragglers that refused to budge.  As I looked, the slight breeze I heard rustling through the trees picked a few of the leaves and tossed them about.

I stepped forward and almost fell - I could hear //everything//.  The feel and noise of my clothes moving against my body was so unfamiliar as to be startling.  I could feel my muscles tense and relax as I moved them, my legs wobbling just a little bit from disuse.  I think I might have even been hungry.

The upper end of the elevator was not as zealously guarded as the lower - there was only one man here, and he looked somewhat surprised to see anyone arriving.  "Can I help you?"

He clearly did not want to help.

I didn't say a word, simply walked past him like I had all the time in the world and still couldn't be bothered to spare any for him.

His reaction was a shrug and a muttered "Your funeral, pal."  Not exactly what I was expecting, but I supposed the problem of tresspassers in New Providence was somewhat self-limiting.  I didn't dare think of how much time my trip would have already cost me had it not been paid for.

* [[Walk down the street|pr_intersection]]



:: pr_intersection
The forest remained a close companion for the walk, only occasionally breaking to reveal dirt roads vanishing into their depths.  Mailboxes ranging from immaculate to rusty adorned each road, though clearly those suffering from rust were doing so by intention of their owner.  Nobody who could afford living here would have to settle for rusty mailboxes.

An sign declared the road I was walking toward to be an intersection between Central and Prometheus.

:: koloman_exterior
Koloman's "house" was a three-story tall log cabin that was bigger than my apartment building.

Granted, that could not have possibly been true, but it was my first impression and it stuck.  It also gave me insight as to why wood paneling was so ubiquitous throughout New Detroit:  Bringing the real thing down to the motor city level of quality would have left little difference between the two.

An older man, burly but greying, stood anxiously outside the door.<<set $kolomanInPerson=0>>

I considered myself a good judge of character.  The ability to tell who's lying and who thinks they're telling the truth was a cornerstone of my business.  So it confused the hell out of me when Koloman appeared genuinely confused.

"I would not have done such a thing."  he said finally.  "I cannot speak with authority on what happened to you during our call, and I do not wish to call your judgement into question - that would bode ill for the both of us - but many who are recent uploads into our world suffer adjustment symptoms.  It may have been that."

When that answer didn't appear to satisfy me (because it didn't), he continued solemnly.  "I swear to you, <<print $gender>> Hallivert, I did not lock you in your room.  I want to hire a detective who is willing to take the case - more, who demands that justice be done.  If you are not that person, I'll not make you agree."

"Why would I lock myself in?"  I asked.

The insurance agent shrugged.  "You can arrange for privacy - designate that certain people not be allowed through your doors.  It's supposed to be impossible to put yourself on that list, but through various miscommunications in the past, it has happened."

"I don't even know how to do that."

"Still - something to keep in mind.  If you find yourself unable to enter or exit your apartment in the future, don't hesitate to contact me.  We may be able to track down the reason if we can catch it while it's happening."

:: koloman_whyme [conversation nocall]
Nickolai nodded at the question.  "A reasonable thing to ask.  There must be, you are thinking, many other detectives with more experience, and more knowledge of how the system functions."

I'd more been wondering which of my specific virtues he'd thought of when he called me.

Koloman continued talking.  "This is true.  You are inexperienced in this world and, compared to some of those here who have been investigators for over a century total, inexperienced at the job.  It is precisely for these reasons that I wish to hire you."

This was not a very good pep speech.

"I am not sure if you have noticed, but police presense in New Detroit is... nil, to put it nicely.  There are men who used to be police in their former lives, but most of them have retired.  There is no need to police when the simulation can do so automatically, with far greater coverage and effectiveness.  Hmph.

"What I am saying is that any overly-visible response such as hiring an expensive investigator would bring these men out of their retirement.  They have even less experience than you, but wield considerable clout.  They would make a show out of the investigation - moreso than it already is - and, I suspect, be ineffective at the actual investigating. 

"You, on the other hand, can ask questions in nearly complete freedom.  You are new to the system, it is expected that you will not understand it and will need to ask questions.  You have been assured of your immortality and yet seen someone stripped of that very guarantee.  Every act of investigation will be expected of you naturally."

I frowned.  "So does this mean I won't officially be on the case?"  I'd already seen what dropping Koloman's name could do in terms of getting people to co-operate; it was a powerful weapon I'd rather not be without.

"You will very much be on this case, <<print $gender>> Hallivert."  Koloman answered stonily.  "It will appear to the officials and gossips of this town that I am not taking my daughter's death seriously with your hire, and I am prepared to endure such accusations because I believe you will find me answers."

I found myself wishing that Samahd had been drinking something when I said that - his reaction indicated I'd have witnessed an actual spit-take.

"Koloman?  As in Nickolai 'more money than God himself' Koloman?"

I smiled a bit.  I hadn't thought I'd ever have been able to surprise Samahd.  "Or so he claimed.  This is his card."

The tour guide took Koloman's card and turned it over.  "Holy hell, that's his actual card!"  He didn't hand it back, instead it disappeared.  I resisted the urge to check my wallet to make sure it had returned there.  Hadn't Samahd himself said I couldn't be robbed?

"I take it he's a bigshot?"

Samahd nodded.  "The biggest of shots, my friend.  Koloman Industries owns and operates the fabs that make half the hardware these sims run on.  Note that - sims.  Plural.  He lives up in New Providence on a //lifetime pass//.  And that's his new, non-mortal lifetime."

"I should take the job, then?"  I didn't think I really needed to ask the question, but Samahd surprised me.

"No.  Well, you should definitely go up there and listen.  If he's sponsoring you a free trip to New Providence?  Go just to experience it.  New Detroit will never seem the same.  But accept the job?  I wouldn't be so fast.  If someone rich as the king of bankers wants something from you and is willing to pay accordingly, it's going to be damn near impossible to actually do.

"I was a neurobiologist."

I'd been lied to plenty in my life, but this one very nearly took the cake.  "Bullshit."  I replied.

Samahd hoisted his glass.  "I swear upon this beer, I was a neurobiologist in life."  I was't sure whether his drinking the object of his vow invalidated it, but it didn't seem to stop him.

"But you're a tour guide."  I stated.  I began considering the idea that Samahd was actually independently wealthy and just showing newbies around as a form of slumming.

"I don't know if you follow the trade," Samahd replied in a tone that indicated he knew exactly how much I followed his trade, "but neurobiology is on the outs."

He started counting off reasons on his fingers.  "One:  The biology part.  The only part of biology you need is the part that makes the sensors for the brain-upload machines.

"Two:  The 'neuro' part.  All of that is done by computers pretty much exactly like the one you're currently in.  If you want to do research, you just get consent from someone who's already been uploaded and watch their brain do their thing.  You barely have to know anything about neurons or how they're connected because the machines take care of that.

"Three:  You can't do it from inside the machine.  At least not here in New Olympus; got outlawed sometime back, probably because someone wrecked someone else's brain or something.

"Four:  There's no money in it.  Once the technology got good enough to do a full simulation, why bother doing anything else?  You've got your AI researchers making better machine intelligences, but that kinda rules out biology by definition."

Samahd's omnipresent smile had actually dampened somewhat at this point, and he seemed to take a moment to put it back into place.  "Sorry if I sound cynical.  The ghosts of factory workers everywhere are laughing at me for being replaced by a machine, especially now that I am one.  I can't be too angry - the field used to be decently paying if not lucrative, and I could afford a few decades of afterlife, so it's not too bad."

* [[You have more questions|convo_ferro]]



:: ferro_locked [conversation nocall]
Samahd looks dumbfounded.  "What, you'd been locked //in//?  So far as I know, that's impossible.  Well, it's impossible to get stuck either way when it comes to your own property.  Only person who could do that is Athena herself, and I doubt her holiness bothers slumming it on this level just to pull a few pranks."

"It happened."  I replied tersely.  I was getting a little tired of people not believing something I'd rather vividly lived through.

Samahd just shrugged.  "I've got an answer you're not going to like:  noob fever."

"What," I enunciated, "the hell," I added for emphasis, "is noob fever?"

My tour guide looked like he was debating between cracking up at this question and sparing me some dignity.  Fortunately for both of us, he chose the second option.

"Kinda a slang term, in case you hadn't figured it out.  And like I said, you're not going to like it.  But not everyone who uploads uploads... whole.  Used to happen a lot more often, when the system was new and parts were still experimental.  Still happens from time to time, though.  There are patterns in the brain that take a while to adapt to a simulated experience.  Like you've probably slept since you got here, right?  You don't need sleep, but it's so hardwired into your brain that it'll take you a few months to realize it."

"So sleeping makes you crazy?"  It was the most reasonable of the various ridiculous ideas floating through my head.

"Not what I'm saying, it was just an example of something that holds over from life.  Some folks, they still get hungry or thirsty for awhile.  But in some cases, it's worse.  Schizophrenia sets in for some folks.  Psychosis, agoraphobia, mania - depression too, but that's pretty treatable."

"So I'm crazy."  I was pretty sure I wasn't crazy, but wasn't that what all crazy people thought?

"Also not what I'm saying.  I'm saying it's a spectrum, okay?  It's called noob //fever// because, like a fever, it goes away.  People've come in to the sim ranting that the lizard people are the true masters of the world, and a few weeks down the line they're be laughing about how utterly crazy that all seems now."

Even though I was utterly certain that I'd endured that strange episode in my apartment, it was still relieving to hear that, even if it was in my head, it was probably temporary.

"The hub's not on the tour, but I covered that.  None of the upper cities is on the tour because it'd be a shitload more expensive.  Ditto off-grid - besides, real world tour guides don't take you to other cities either, right?"

He shook his head, still grinning.  Then, eyebrows cocked, he leaned in.  "No, the //real// answer that nobody else will talk about is the wrong side of the tracks."

I replied with my most bland look.  It's a trick in my arsenal that communicates a sentiment roughly equivalent to "you have given me so little information I can't even start being interested in what you're going on about."

"I know, I know, you want the real info.  And I know, I'm off hours.  But this one?  It would cost me my job.  Lemme just tell you that there's a reason the area has that name, and it's not just because it's across some railroad tracks."

"If you're a respectable citizen, sure.  And even if you're not so respectable, like you and I.  Anyone can cross the tracks, it's the people who //want// to you have to look out for."

"You're being splendidly helpful."  I also had a bland tone of voice.

Samahd shrugged.  "Yep, it's what I do.  Listen, I'm not going to tell you not to go.  Well, actually, I am going to tell you that.  Don't go.  But I know someone like you isn't going to listen.

The architects who created New Detroit clearly had an extremely generic template - the Courthouse could not have looked any more the part.  Faux-marble stairs, textured columns, even a statue of justice out front.

<<if $tourInProgress>>
"You probably will never see the inside of this place unless you decide to become a history buff." 
Samahd said.  "Used to be the center of law and order in this place, trials and everything, but it turns out it's easier just to make the sim so crimes can't be committed."

He pointed to the flat wall of a convenience store.  "For instance, say you had a spraycan and you felt like tagging your name all over that thing."  He rummaged through his pockets for a moment.  "Damn, I don't have one.  I usually bring one for this demonstration.  Anyway, it wouldn't work.  You don't own that store, you don't have permission to modify it, you can't do anything to it."

After a few more moments he pulled an ordinary-looking keyring from his pocket.  "I'd say 'at least I remembered these' but as it happens they're always with you.  They look like keys - old metal style keys, you've probably noticed the taste for antiques around here - and they act like them, letting you into doors, opening whatever you've locked, that kind of thing.  You've likely got one for your apartment."

Dubiously, I reached into my pocket and pulled out a keyring.  It had one key, featuring the number "1336" emblazoned on it.  I let go and the ring and key vanished.  Patting the outside of my pocket revealed nothing, but reaching in again resulted in the same key.  I hadn't even felt it there.

"A lot of abstractions work like that - your entry permissions being actual keys, the time-is-money concept being made into real bills.  New Detroit's got an old-time asthetic because there's no point in having it look technological.  We're not only surrounded by technology, we //are// technology.  No need to lug around a holographic projector for your phone when old-fasioned business cards can do the same thing."

I mean, the whole sim is theirs so I think they figure if you're here you're as good as converted anyway.  But still, if you want to go all-in on the worship thing, these guys have you covered."

He took a few moments of precious precious silence to let me look over the building before continuing.  "Obviously, they're rich, but they don't pay much.  I mean, it's a church.  Most people volunteer."

New Detroit was a full-fledged city, and it was easy to forget that elsewhere.  Here, in the heart of the shopping district, it was obvious.  The hustle and bustle of human movement and conversation was more muted than it'd have been in the real world, but it still managed to be omnipresent.  And as in the real world, shopping seemed to be more popular than any other activity.

<<if $tourInProgress>>
"I wouldn't go on a spending spree right away!"  Samahd was having to speak up to be heard which, given the unrestrained volume he usually spoke at, was saying something.

He lead us toward a marginally more quiet corner of what was essentially a large strip mall.

"If you want to get a job, this is the easiest place to do it.  Some people order out of catalogs that act like the network-accessible shops you might be used to, but most people figure if they're going to get all old-timey, they're going to do it right.  In-person sales are pretty popular.  It only pays minimum wage - that's an hour per hour - but that'll extend you quite a bit."

He leaned back against the wall and people-watched for a while, which mostly forced me to do the same.  Shoppers here seemed focused and uninclined to talk, despite all the babble I heard in the air.

"Okay," Samahd was apparently done.  "enough regular people.  Let's go to the Arts District"

The Arts District was Broadway.  As it turned out, that wasn't a metaphor - someone had taken the entire cityscape of New York's theater district, scaled down the fidelity, mixed it up a bit, and placed it in New Detroit.

I wasn't sure which, if any, of the details they'd gotten correct, but the neon lights were in fact bright.

<<if $tourInProgress>>
"Shopping's a good pastime, but if you want more classy sort of entertainment - well, as classy as you're likely to find in this city - the arts district here is the best place to do it." Samahd was standing in front of the Park Theater, which I'd been pretty sure had burned down centuries ago.  People were apparently not the only things that got afterlives.

"Prices here are pretty reasonable.  Your real theater snobs are all up in New Amsterdam at a far better rendition of this building.  This is bottom floor for artists of all stripes, so you can even catch free shows."

Finally, after what felt like hours of false starts, I got a word in edgewise.  "I suppose you can get hired on as an usher?"

Samahd laughed.  "Yes, actually.  Most people here are actors, painters, musicians.  Being an usher would be better work if you could get it.  Everyone wants to start a band but, well, you know the phrase 'starving artist'?  It somehow manages to be true even in a place where you can't possibly starve."

"Listen, Koloman," I snapped, "I just got here.  I'm confused and pissed off and I just had my very first night of sleep interrupted by some antique with a megaphone ringer and some guy who already wants something from me.  So no, whatever it is, the answer is no."<<set $flagRejected=1>>

The Games District was obvious - it was surrounded by golf courses.  The sudden lack of buildings hanging over me gave me the strange fleeting feeling of agoraphobia.

<<if $tourInProgress>>
"If you haven't guessed why this is separate from the arts district yet," Samahd said, gesturing to the greens, "it's because it's about three times bigger."

We passed a few voleyball courts and a soccer field.  "Every sport on the planet is represented here, and some new ones that you can't do in the real world.  I wouldn't recommend starting with those, by the way."  He pointed to a three-story tall translucent cube that apparently featured rapidly changing gravity as a core game mechanic.

"You mostly see sports-style games because those take the most room."  He pointed toward a small building off the main road.  "That leads to the arcades, underground.  Every video game we could licence - and with the kind of money the architects were throwing around, it was a lot - is available there, 15 minutes per play.  It ranges from some of the more recent full-immersion games - much easier to play here than in the real world, you don't need a sim implant or anything - to old-style mechanical pinball."

"Take it from me," he came to a halt at the intersection, "your video game skills, if any, will carry over into this world, but your athletic skills won't.  I was a researcher but played softball on the side.  Couldn't play it at all once I got uploaded.  Game's the same, but you kinda have to re-learn your proprioception."

That explained why my reflexes were terrible, at least.

"Come on, we've got a train to catch."

:: apartment_window_fail_2
My first thought was to solve one problem with another - I moved to pick up the cast-iron phone and throw it through the window, but naturally the phone wouldn't budge.

That wasn't going to stop me.  I grabbed the television, lifted, and threw.

Naturally, it bounced off of the window pane like rubber.  The one time furniture was indestructible, and it somehow managed to bite me in the ass.

The voice on the other end of the line seemed perfectly professional.  "Detective Sam Hallivert?"

"Yes.  Who is this?  Why the hell did you put a phone in my apartment and then call me on it?"

"Put a phone in your-" the man on the other end of the line was confused for a moment.  "Oh!  The cardless call, I apologize for that.  The phone you're holding is an artifact of the sort of call I'm placing to you.  I don't have your card, so I'm making a direct call.  It's often intrusive, and I apologize, but this is important.  I have an offer for you, detective."

I wasn't going to give the mysterious phone prankster the satisfaction of an answer.  I was getting out of here, one way or another.  I turned to the window and pulled upward.

As I should have expected, it also didn't move.

<<set $sleepy=0>>Sleep in the sim was an abrupt thing.  I was awake, then I was awake again, and it was morning.  Of course, the darkness of the skies outside hadn't diminished, but I apparently wore a wristwatch now.  It hadn't even occurred to me to set an alarm, but they didn't seem necessary in this world.

<<if not $hasHadRecruitmentCall>>
Of course, a more likely cause of my waking was the cast iron rotary phone sitting on the nightstand.  I was reasonably certain that neither the phone nor the nightstand had been present the evening before, but I couldn't really think very hard on the topic.  My thoughts were disrupted by the noise the thing was making, a noise I hadn't heard since I was a kid.  The phone was ringing.

Clearly, getting the hell out of here was a better option than either putting up with the noise or dealing with whoever'd planted it in my apartment while I slept.  I put my hand on the doorknob and turned.

741 McGraw St, Apartment #1336 - I knew it was my home without having to consult any notes, or even having to be told.  And it was a good thing, too - the apartment complex was one of dozens, exactly alike, copied-and-pasted like the insurance waiting room furniture on a massive scale.

Samahd smiled and gestured magnificently to the particular grey slab that was my building.  "And here we have nearly come full circle.  This is your home, and where our tour ends."

He turned to face down the road.  "For reference, this way leads back to the insurance offices, and over there leads to the neighborhood people around here call "The Hub".  It's an easy way to get across the city without having to walk through half the districts, but it's not on the tour because it's boring.  Keep in mind that this is a tour that features an insurance company, so when I say 'boring', I mean //boring//.

"And finally," with a deft twist of his hand, he produced a business card like the one Guillory had given me.  "Here's my card.  I like to keep in touch with the people I show around, and I'm always willing to answer questions.  Feel free to call anytime."<<set $cardFerro=1>>

With a hearty wave goodbye, Tour Guide Samahd Ferro walked away down the street.

:: asylum_exterior
A sign outlined in brick proclaimed the building behind the thick iron fence to be the "Shady Acres Retirement Home".  The building itself wasn't exactly welcoming, either.  It looked like a cross between a cheap hotel and a hospital.

<<if $tourInProgress>>
"You can't get in here without an invite" Samahd leaned up against the also-thick-iron gate.  "And trust me, that's for your own good, not theirs."

He gestured to one of the windows.  "Those are the only windows in the city that are one-way.  Special dispensation from Athena, because what's going on in there is not pleasant.

"Sorry, don't mean to get all spookhouse on you, it's just the place has a bad reputation.  For the most part, it's full of people who've been in the simulation for a very long time, but for whatever reasons don't want to go into Storage.  Lots of people who were in the first wave of uploads, way back when.  It was more experimental in those days, and it didn't always work right.  Plus you've got the people who've got the double bad luck to have died bad and remember their deaths.  Physical trauma is a thing of the past if you stay on the right side of the tracks, but PTSD is forever."

He shook his head sadly.  "So yeah, the hospital look is not an accident."

Just as quickly, though, he seemed to come out of his reverie.  "Well, isn't that a high note to go out on.  Come on, tour's almost over, time to show you your new digs."

The train station consisted entirely of an awning over the waiting area by the tracks and a ticketing station manned by one supremely bored person.

A chalkboard featured the current transit prices:
* ''Metaverse:'' 8.45 centuries
* ''Satya Yuga:'' 3.10 centuries
* ''Valhalla:'' 1.20 centuries
* ''New Olympus:  You are here.''

<<if $tourInProgress>>
"I mentioned earlier how the elevator doesn't take you off-grid." Samahd ignored the ticketing agent, and was ignored in return.  "Well this does.  If you wanted to visit any of the other sims we're networked to, this is the place."

He walked up to the chalkboard.  "Of course, moving all the data that makes up a human being isn't exactly cheap, as you can see, and those prices don't include however much it'll cost to simulate you once you're there.  If you want my advice, save up for a day trip to New Amsterdam, see the beaches.  As expensive as that is, it's way more worth it."

:: bed
The cot was, as I'd already guessed, exactly as featureless as the chairs in the waiting room had been.  I made a mental note to try lying on the floor some time to see if it felt any different whatsoever.

Still, I'd gotten sleep in worse places.

:: apartment_interior
Apartment 1336 was a 55-square-meter studio apartment.  It was sparsely decorated, as I'd assumed an apartment that nobody lived in until now would be, but it was at least furnished.

A leather-colored [[couch]] took the center stage, sitting across from an irritatingly small 50cm [[television]] that looked like something out of the black-and-white era.  If it didn't get color I was prepared to call bullshit on the entire idea of retrotechnology.

The kitchen nook featured a [[refrigerator]] and a few empty cupboards.  So far as I could tell, there was no laundry or bathroom - hopefully they weren't necessities in this world.

A [[bed]] that seemed barely a step up from a cot was shoved into the far corner.  <<if $sleepy>>Despite the fact that it is the very minimum required for an object to be called a 'bed', it was possibly the most inviting space I'd seen all day.  All I wanted to do was [[sleep]].<<endif>>

* [[Go out into the hallway|floor_13]]



:: floor_13
My floor was, I highly suspected, exactly the same as all the others.  Room 36 was all the way to one end, and it was fortunate that they were all labeled.  The slightly garish false-gold numbers looked incredibly cheap; I could only hope that they were as indestructible as most everything else had thus far proven to be, or else I was very likely going to become lost in a maze of blank doors.

The apartment interior featured more of the famed wood paneling.  Likely the exact same paneling, I reflected, if the copy-paste temperment was as pervasive inside as out.

A large glass double-door lead out to the streets, and a permanently propped open metal door pointed the way to the concrete stairway.  Whoever architected this must have figured an elevator was pointless when you can't possibly become exhausted.  I wanted to punch him.

<<if $sleepy>>First, though, I was going to need some sleep.<<endif>>

:: television
Turning on the television was a lot faster once I realized there wasn't a remote control and I'd have to fiddle with the dials on the machine.

The television network in the afterlife was far worse than its real-world equivalent, mainly because for some reason there were no real-world shows.  Most channels appeared to be live feeds of various stages in the Arts District, and most of those were not active at the moment.
<<if not $heardOfDeath>>
<<set $heardOfDeath=1>>
One channel was news.  I was about to change the channel again when the headline at the bottom caught my eye:

''Iva Koloman Dead''

The announcer was doing his best to sound professional, but I could tell - he was at least a little bit rattled.

"To repeat, Athena has just confirmed with Motor News One that Iva Koloman is in fact dead.  Such a thing hasn't happened since the early days of our world, of course, and Athena stressed that - while she is still investigating - this is almost certainly an isolated incident.  Iva Koloman, 34, was found yesterday morning in her apartment by her fiancé.  The unresponsive state of her body and the system's inability to contact her lead many to speculate that she had died.  Moments ago, Athena confirmed this was the case."

Great, I'd died just in time for mortality to come to the afterlife.
<<else>>
/%%/
The news was continuing its coverage of the Koloman case, and little else.  It made me wonder what they did on days nobody died.  I hoped I'd have the chance to find out.

The couch didn't feel like leather.  It felt exactly the same as the chairs in the insurance building had - supportive, but otherwise barely present.  It wasn't exactly an //un//comfortable situation, but it was a far cry from comfort.

:: refrigerator
My refrigerator was empty.  I supposed, given the fact that things in this world generally worked like the outside only with strange edge cases, that it was for storing food (as opposed to the cupboards?).

It made me wonder if I needed to eat.  I didn't feel hungry and I hadn't eaten all day.  Then again, I clearly needed sleep, so could the other necessities be that far behind?
