<<endsilently>>The afterlife had wood paneling.

It'd ordinarily be an absurd thing to notice.  I was dead, after all, in the hereafter's own waiting room.  You'd think there'd be pearly gates, or at least a hint of brimstone, but instead?

It was a waiting room.  Wood paneling on the walls, an oblong receptionist counter complete with bored-looking [[receptionist]] doing her best not to make eye contact... it was only missing some out of date magazines and it'd be perfect.  I'd have to mention it to whoever ran the place.

:: receptionist
I made my way up to the receptionist.

"Sam Hallivert" I said.  "I suppose I have an appointment?"

The receptionist looked up at me as though I was barely more interesting than the game of solitaire she'd been cheating at.  "Not as such, no."  She went back to the game.

I waited for her to continue talking, and she waited for me to sit back down.  She had the advantage of long hours' practice at ignoring waiting rooms, but I was dead.  It wasn't as though I had anywhere else to be.

She looked back up.  "Mr. Guillory will see you as soon as he is available.  Please wait your turn."

I glanced back at the row of four seats that apparently sufficed as a waiting room.  Without me there to provide bulk, they were empty.  I opened my mouth to-

"He's with a client."  the receptionist said before I could even turn my head back.

I nodded.  She'd won this round.<<set $guilloryPhone="Test">>

:: intro_wait
I was expecting the seats to either be uncomfortably thin or absurdly over-stuffed, in the style of waiting room seats everywhere.  These looked thin but didn't feel it.  They didn't feel like much of anything, to be honest.  I could have been sitting on a box and leaning against the wall and gotten more of a sensory experience out of it.

That I was reduced to mentally critiquing the furniture indicated a lot about my [[mental state|intro_mentalstate]].

* [[Wait|intro_invite_in]]


:: intro_mentalstate
Some part of me kept insisting that I ought to be panicking right now.  I was dead, killed in the prime of my life by...  well, I couldn't remember how I died precisely, but I didn't really feel like knowing the grisly details of my demise at the moment anyway.

The point was, I was dead and I ought to be upset by it, but I couldn't find it within myself to really care that hard.  Obviously, there was an afterlife - I was in it.  The fact that it lacked a certain polish was a minor detail.

:: power_of_two_exterior
"The Power of Two" sounded like it ought to be a bordello, and as I got closer to the building I could tell that this impression was, if anything, understated.

Posters of naked women covered every available surface of the building, in many cases obscuring each other and in some places overlapping with the neon sign naming the building.  A very few ordinary signs were visible:  One proclaiming "Titanic Tits!" and another in much smaller type explaining that the cover charge to enter was 1 day.
<<if $tourInProgress>>
Samahd gestured to the display and wiggled his eyebrows suggestively.  "I'm not here to judge!".

Grinning, he donned his tour-guide voice.  "This, as you've probably guessed, is New Detroit's premiere whorehouse.  Athena - that's the AI that runs this sim - doesn't let people just turn their brain's pleasure center on and ignore the world, so sex is still very much a thing!  It's got some benefits over the real thing.  No diseases, nobody can possibly get pregnant, nobody's forced into it because you can't be forced into anything here - it's pretty much the best brothel ever, anywhere."

He shrugs.  "That's the official line, anyway.  It's kinda pricey for my taste.  Head up this way and I'll show you my hangout."

:: intro_invite_in
The door finally opened, and a bespectacled man in his early forties stepped out, holding a manilla folder.  Wherever I was, it was decidedly low-tech.

"Sam Hallivert?" he said, looking up and meeting my gaze.  He at least had the dignity to look slightly embarassed at asking a question with an obivous answer. "Ah.  Right this way, if you would."

* [[Follow him|intro_guillory]]


:: intro_guillory
What choice did I have?  As strangely at-peace as I was with my current morbid state of affairs, I still had questions. "Alex", as his gilded nametag proclaimed him to be, presumably had answers.

He turned back through the door, and I followed.

I'd been expecting a doctor's office - as much or as little as that made sense for a dead man - but what I got instead was "insurance agent".

<html><div class="center">
Alex Guillory<br/>

</div></html>

I frowned at the desk plaque as Alex moved behind it and took his seat.  Insurance?  It was naggingly familiar and utterly bewildering at the same time.

If Guillory noticed my reaction, he didn't say anything.  Instead, he gestured toward the seat behind me - identical to those in the waiting room, so far as I could tell - and said "Mr. Hallivert, please, have a seat."

Guillory looked at me for a moment, then back at his folder.  Finally, shaking his head as though to clear it, he took a pen and made some note I couldn't see from my vantage point.  "My apologies, Ms. Hallivert, there was a mistake in our files.  Please take a seat."

Guillory launched into what I could tell was a well-recited speech.

"<<print $gender>> Hallivert, I'm sure you have many questions, and this entire experience is likely very disorienting for you.  However, to best help you through it, I'd like to ask you a few questions.  Is that acceptable?"

I frowned.  "I'd prefer not to."  I said in a very specific mild tone.  Specifically, that mild tone of voice used to imply that one has a wide variety of more persuasive methods should mild tones not work.

Guillory was either unfamiliar with the tone or completely unimpressed by it.  "I can imagine so, but it really is to help you."

I nodded, supressing a weary laugh.  "Yeah.  I'm dead."

Guillory put down the pen and nodded, seemingly relieved.  "Ah, yes, that is the case.  I am glad that you've already realized it - many people, even after being briefed, take quite a while to come to that conclusion."

He paused for a moment, smiling, but then suddenly seemed to remember he had work to do.  "Are you ready for the next question?"

* [[You're ready for the next question|intro_question_2]]

I did my most convincing I-don't-know-nothing shrug.  "You tell me."

Guillory made a note in the folder.  "Ah, I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news then.  I'm afraid you've died."  He followed this up immediately, as though afraid I was about to erupt in emotion.  "There's nothing to be worried about, you're fine now!  As I'll explain, you have a new life now with us, and it's every bit as full of potential as your last."

He studied me for a few moments.  "May I ask you another question?"

:: insurance_exterior
I stood in front of the Life Preservers Insurance building - a middling grey cube in the sea of middling grey cubes that apparently made up this place.  It was dark - and I very quickly got the impression that it was always dark - but surprisingly quiet for a modern city.  No horns blared, nobody yelled from the window of their car.  There didn't appear to be any traffic whatsoever, that I noticed.  A few people trudged by now and then, silent in their contemplation or more likely spending all their mental energy on gathering the willpower necessary to take another step.

:: bar_ocho_exterior
Bar Ocho looks like someone took the platonic ideal of 'Bar' and copy-pasted it into the city.  Considering the fact that this was a simulated city, that might not have been too far from the truth.  The name of the bar was in neon, as far too many building signs seemed to be.  The "O" in "Ocho" was overlaying a large stylized 8-ball.  I found myself wondering if anyone played pool in New Detroit.

<<if $tourInProgress>>
Samahd stood to the side of the bar's door.  "For future reference, this is where I am on almost all of my downtime.  I mean, I'll give you my card at the end of the tour, but not everything is business, right?  Sometimes you need to unwind.  That's what this place is for!  The beer's not as effective as on the outside, but the upside is that you can't become addicted to it.  Simulation doesn't allow it.  Great, huh?"

He gestured up to the non-buzzing neon sign.  "Oh, another thing.  See that sign?  That's a pun in my language.  'Borracho' means 'drunk'.  Despite the America-centric theme of the city names, there are more languages spoken here than in any other one place on earth.  Turns out translation is only hard for computers when they don't have full access to the mind-state of the people doing the talking.  So if you never got to learn another language in your previous life, don't worry!  You'll never need to!"

He stepped away from the door and started walking up the street, pointing to a large vertical column in the distance.  The slightly glowing blue cylinder was far taller than any other building - or anything I'd ever seen in either life.  "That thing is our next stop."

:: intro_answer_2
I shrugged.  I'd gathered I was dead, that the afterlife was poorly decorated, and that angels (or devils, the state of my soul was still up in the air) had names like "Alex Guillory".  Everything else was news to me.

Alex made a note in my file and nodded.  "Memory can take a while to be re-accessible."  He closed the folder and looked up at me.  "Well, I have answers."

He gestured around himself, indicating that I should take in the room.  There wasn't much to see - the same faux-wood paneling on the walls, an uninspired plastic desk, the job plaque I'd noted earlier, a cup of pens.

I'd been a private investigator in my previous life, though, so I also noticed what wasn't in the room.

Guillory's desk only had his plaque, the pens, and the manilla folder.  There were no ports to plug anything into, and no ports for output.  The holographic projection interface you'd need if you wanted to use the desk for anything other than putting things on was conspicuously absent.  The desk was either a great deal less advanced than the desks I was familiar with, or a great deal more.

Now that I was thinking about plugs, ports, and electronics I noticed more:  There were no electronics at all, and the corresponding places where they'd interface were also missing.  No charging stations.  There wasn't even a light switch and, now that I was looking, no /light/.

I frowned at the last observation.  The room was lit perfectly - there weren't even shadows.  I'd say it was impossible but I'd already done one impossible thing today just by being here.

:: ferro_tour_accept
<<set $money = $money - 7>><<set $tourInProgress = 1>><<set $ferroInPerson=1>>I looked through my wallet and discovered I had exact change.  Hoping this worked like it did in the real world, I took seven days worth of bills out and handed it over to Samahd.  He smiled and took it, so I must have done something right.

"All right, let's get started!  Let's see, basic information you need to know:  This is New Detroit, the lowest level of the simulation.  You've probably noticed all the lack of amenities - no shadows, no smells, no heat or cold, sounds don't travel far, lots of things lack texture - you get used to it.  You probably wouldn't even have noticed if I hadn't pointed them out." He grinned prankishly and started numbering things on his hand.

"First, you can't die here."  There was something in the tone of his voice when he said this, but as usual I couldn't get him to stop long enough to ask.  "Where would you go, right?  Second, you can't be hurt here unless you go into the wrong neighborhood - and you'll know it if that happens.  Third, you can't be robbed - other people can't even //see// your wallet, let alone take anything out of it.  This Detroit's a lot safer than the real one, if a lot less scenic."

"Fourth:  Don't run out of time.  That's a one-way ticket to Storage.  I'd recommend getting a job - even one that pays one day per day is a pretty good gig, keeps you going."

Samahd looked down at his hands as though he'd forgotten something, then shook his head to dismiss it.  "Anyway, enough about the new motor city in general, let's get specific."

He smiled his tour-guide smile and gestured to the Insurance building behind us.  "This, as you're probably already aware, is the Life Preservers Insurance building.  Drop-off point for new uploads fresh off the bus.  They've got customer service agents always ready to talk, they sometimes help with job placement if you're willing to pay for it.  Kinda self-defeating if you ask me, but hey, whatever works."

"Up this way is the Power of Two."  Samahd started walking up the street.

"This place is no insurance agency, that's for sure."  I said, gesturing to his plaque.

Guillory chuckled.  "Actually, we are."  Opening the folder again, he pulled out a rather large bundle of paper, stapled together.  I hadn't remembered the folder holding that much, but I didn't get the chance to ask before Guillory turned the paper to face me and put it down on the desk.  "This is your policy."

I wanted to ask Guillory for clarification, but I had the feeling the policy would speak for itself.  Unsurprisingly, it was by the same naggingly familiar "Life Preservers Insurance" and seemed to be pretty standard legalese.  I was about to give up and simply demand an answer when a portion caught my eye.

:: koloman_storage [conversation nocall]
"Oh, no, you misunderstand, she was not a criminal or anything."  Koloman explained.

"I thought storage was a one-way street."  I replied neutrally.  If there was a way out of the afterlife's simulated purgatory, I didn't want to appear too eager to learn about it and scare the guy off.

"Ordinarily, yes.  These circumstances were different - the contract I'd written up for our placement into the simulation, it covered both of us, but only //both// of us.  We had to arrive at the same time."

A slow frown came over his face.  "I anticipated that I would die first.  I did not want to spend an eternity waiting in a simulated world for my daughter to join me.  It seemed... unseemly to silently hope for her death so that she might live with me again."  He scoffed.  "So the contract stated that the first to die would be placed in storage."

"And it was her."  I tried to say this as neutrally as I possibly could.  In truth, I was reeling from the fact that he'd not only lost his daughter recently, he was losing her for the second time.

"It was."  He replied quietly.  He'd slipped into the somber mood I'd noticed whenever we got on the topic of how his daughter had been in life.  "Undiscovered heart valve problem.  I spent fifteen years in the outside world, waiting for my time to come so that I might join her."

He sighed, then looked back up at me.  "When I did, when I came here, the first face I saw was hers.  She told me about her dreams in Storage, how she'd seen the simulation for what it truly was, and it was beautiful and horrible, awful in the old sense of the term, like a fire that could consume a city."

"I thought Storage was just... storage."  Once again, my newness to the situation was showing.  "You're shipped to some tape backup under a mountain or something."

"It is."  Koloman confirmed.  "Not exactly as you described, but near enough.  You cannot dream in storage, because there is no 'you' to dream!  These were earlier days of the simulation, and I worried that my Iva had been one of those afflicted by the upload.  But aside from her newfound passion for art, there were no signs."

"I hired two other investigators, but they are no longer employed by me."  Nickolai answered simply.

"There are many retired policemen in the city, but thus far only one has decided to become involved.  She is the one who moved my daughter's body to the courthouse - so far as I know, that's where she lives.  Feel free to talk to her, though she's under no obligation to answer either you or me and - believe me - she is well aware of that fact."

"My daughter was an artist.  She had her professional rivals, though there were not many.  She did not seriously compete for their attention, you see.  She was independently - independent even of me - wealthy, she had no need to attract a patron as most in the community did.

"Those few who did compete with her did so out of a desire, I believe, to humble or humiliate.  They saw her as an interloper, a trust-fund dropout slumming for fun.

"I am no doubt biased in my estimation, but I do not believe this was so.  She believed genuinely that the limited palette of a place like New Detroit gave her an artistic canvas unlike anything in the real world.  Her work stood on its own."

:: koloman_suspects_nobody [conversation nocall]
"It is for the best."  Koloman sat back down just as abruptly as he'd stood up.  The manic energy that had infused him just moments before had seemingly fanished.

"So, that suspect must be for now eliminated by virtue of us being unable to investigate.  Still, that is not my only suspect."

He sighed, then smiled.  "This is one of the instances in which I am glad you are new to the system, <<print $gender>> Hallivert.  If I were to say that I suspected hackers, a more savvy citizen would laugh in my face."

I shrugged.  "Sounds like the sort of thing hackers could do."

"And indeed they could, if there were such a thing."  Koloman agreed.  "Anyone who first arrives in the simulation believes that potential hackers are everywhere.  People who would grift time from innocents, perform miracles, do the impossible.  A decade or two of experience and they realize the truth:  There are only ordinary grifters.  Miracles were pre-programmed into the simulation before it even started.  The impossible is mundane.

"Hackers now have the reputation of being a fairy tale, but I'm mentioning them for a reason.  A few months ago, my daughter got involved with their kind.  I don't mean hackers themselves, of course, but gamers.  Wannabes.  People interested in exploring the forbidden edges of the simulation.

He stood suddenly, pacing rather than sitting still.  "This is something I have given much thought.  There is the obvious answer, yes?  Someone who I will not name, because to name the devil is to summon her."  He pointed upward briefly as he said this.  "But you know who I mean, yes?"

Guillory smiled widely.  "That's entirely up to you.  You have most of another whole life ahead of you.  Many of our clients dedicate themselves to art, or mastering a skill that they lacked in life.  Many others simply lie back and relax, treating this as an extended retirement."

He gestured down to the sheaf of paper on his desk that was my insurance policy.  "The policy you purchased in life gives you fifty years of New Detroit time - more specifically, a little over three million seconds subjectively.  Time flows a little bit differently from city to city, but nothing you'll notice unless you spend a while there, and should you be able to afford that you'll likely have more time than you need anyway."

"Afford?"  I looked at him skeptically.  There was always a catch.

"You've no doubt heard the phrase 'time is money'?  Well here it is literally true.<<set $heardTimeIsMoney=1>>  What your policy paid for is enough computing power to simulate you for fifty years at the level of fidelity that New Detroit offers.  That money on the outside became time here.  Time here is a valuable and scarce commodity that cannot be counterfeited.  Your fifty years is currency - a fair bit of it, actually.  I would advise you not to spend it all in one place."

"The process is very technical" Guillory literally handwaved the response.  At least he had the decency to almost immediately realize that I wasn't going to find that a satisfactory answer.

"Well," he began again, "your soulkeeper <<set $heardOfSoulkeeper=1>>is extracted after your death.  Its patterns are fed into the large banks of machinery that make up this world, and those computers then add your mind to its simulation."

"Simulation."  I said.  Suddenly the copy-and-paste furniture made a great deal more sense.

"Yes.  I don't know your religious leanings, <<print $gender>> Hallivert, but this is not a spiritual afterlife.  You are currently within the memory and processors of nearly five thousand top-of the line servers at a data-center in Boulder City, Nevada."

He sighed.  "I have much work to do once this investigation is complete."  His mood shifted suddenly, the defeated hunched-over posture becoming ramrod straight, the frown intensifying into a teeth-gritting grimace.  "Once I know the criminal's name, yes... much to do."

"The Soulkeeper is you - at least, the you that you are now."

Guillory saw my nonplussed expression.

"Well, it's a bit more technical than what I'm about to describe, but simply put, the soulkeeper contains a few hundred billion tiny machines.  These machines are very small - the term 'microscopic' is too large, to give you an idea - such that all these machines can quite easily fit within your head."

I didn't like where this was going.  Obviously I couldn't argue the end result, but the process was already sounding very uncomfortable.

The insurance agent seemed to notice my discomfort.  "It's actually quite noninvasive.  The machines are smaller than even your own brain cells.  That's their job, after all - once implanted, each device finds a nerve to latch on to.  From there, it goes about recording everything.  What causes this nerve to fire?  What levels of neurotransmitters are present at the time it does so?  When does this nerve die, and if this happens what is the cause?  Is there a replacement?"

"So they learned how to be me."  I observed.

Guillory nodded.  "Exactly!"

"That is somewhat of an important point - we are not a traditional insurance company.  We do not insure houses, or health, or even life in the usual manner - though much of the funding that finances your part of the simulation is derived from a life insurance policy.

"Samahd Ferro, Tour Guide." he said.  "I've got other titles - welcome wagon, noob patrol, New Arrival Emotional Well-Being Adjuster - it's just that the 'Tour Guide' thing is the most honest.

"No offense taken, it was a question I asked her many times."  His tone indicated he hadn't gotten a particularly compelling explanation himself.

"She was an artist, fascinated by the medium that is the simulation.  I don't mean that she was fascinated by working within the simulation, I mean that she found the simulation //itself// to be a medium.

"She was not the first to think so, of course, the idea of reality as a canvas pre-dates realities as mutable as this one.  And the restrictions placed on this simulation at all levels mean it is much less mutable than one would hope.  Still, she worked to express this idea through the more mundane mediums.

"Why New Detroit?  She believed it to be somehow more authentic.  New Providence is the most detailed of the simulated realities, but Iva did not find it to be //real//.  The least realistic level of the simulation was closest to the computer, and thus more resembling the reality of the fact that we are living inside a machine."

"I'm not sure I follow."  I replied.  

"Neither did I."  Nickolai did not seem the artistic sort.  "It is so strange.  Before her death - her... first death, I suppose I should say -she was an accountant, she dealt in the concrete of numbers.  She preferred it to the less definable careers, kept at it even after the advent of GAAAI meant machines could do her job better than she could."

"This company was founded by the Preservationist movement, of course, and a fair amount of stock is still owned by the church.  But-" he held up a finger to stress the point "we don't require that our clients adopt, share, or even entertain such beliefs.

"Obviously, believing that people should be preserved after they die and working at an agency like this are quite compatible.  Similarly, those that believe in a non-digitizable soul that they will take with them to a true afterlife are unlikely to sign up for our services.  Still, we are open to all."

Despite the calming tone, I didn't like the sound of Storage.

Guillory had anticipated my next question.  "Yes, Storage is what it sounds like.  Your patterns that are currently in simulation now are stored on disk - and also redundantly backed up, of course.  You will no longer be simulated, but of course it's the Preservationist belief that eventually simulation costs will be so low that everyone can be revived for free.

"He strikes me as a mostly reputable businessman" was the eventual answer.  "I only have access to public records, of course, but he doesn't seem to be particularly cutthroat.  His manufacturing concerns are simply more efficient than his competitors, likely due to proprietary techniques.  Koloman Industries applied for 1500 patents last year alone."

"Thanks."  I replied.  It was probably the most I was going to get from someone who was himself answerable to a corporation.

"Yeah, this stage of the sim, the city we call New Detroit, it's just above the brain-in-a-jar level.  You get most of your brain simulated but almost none of your internal organs.  Cuts down on the overhead of the sim, you can fit more people in cheaply.

"Ever have a dream that, when you wake up, you realize was utterly absurd?" Again, without waiting for an answer, he continued, "Why didn't you realize it in the dream?  I mean, four-armed gorilla monsters from space aren't even remotely real, but your dream-self doesn't question it.  It's the same thing here.  There's a part of your brain dedicated to constantly asking the question 'does this make any damn sense at all?'.  In dreams, it's shut off.  Here?  It's not even simulated."

He gestured back to the column.  "That's not the case everywhere.  The next city up is New Phoenix.  They've got shadows, better physics, more texture, better sound, but still no internals.  It's the same sim, keep in mind that this isn't taking you off-grid or anything, it's just that they dedicate a lot more computing power to NPX.  It costs a lot more too, though - the ratio of New Detroit time to New Phoenix time is about 50:1.  One day's vacation would cost you a couple months.  That scale's just about the same all the way up, too.  Next city's New Amsterdam, and that's fifty times more expensive than New Phoenix.  Top of the pack is New Providence.  It's fifty times more expensive than NA.  I don't know if you've done the math, but that means you could spend a lifetime in a few minutes."

He shook his head.  "Too rich for our blood, in other words.  Come on, let me show you the courthouse."

I hadn't noticed it the first time I'd been here, but there was no place to buy a ticket.  No salespeople, no kiosk, not even a vending machine.  Instead, each had been replaced with a guard.

<<if not $nftElevator>><<set $nftElevator=1>>I found out why when I tried to get into the elevator - one of the more intimidating-looking of them stepped in front of me.

"<<if $gender eq "Mr.">>Sir,<<else>>Miss,<<endif>> I'm going to have to ask you to step back.  The elevator's closed due to investigation."

I decided to see exactly how much clout Koloman purportedly had.  I pulled out the card for display.  "I've got an urgent appointment with Nikolai Koloman."

Whatever his faults - and waking me up in the morning still ranked pretty heinously - Koloman had not been a liar.  The guard visibly stiffened and almost seemed like he was about to salute me.  "Of course, my apologies, go right ahead."

The guard who initially stopped me was this time nodding politely.  It was good to have connections.<<endif>>

New Providence continued to be startling.  Even though I'd been here before, the sheer contrast between it and New Detroit was going to take longer to get used to than I could afford.

<<set $nftNpr=1>>New Providence took my breath away.  It did this by first giving me the ability to breathe.  Air, real air, filled my lungs as I inhaled for the first time since I'd died.  And then I saw the scenery.

It was a cool autumn afternoon - a setting sun threw intricate shadows through the thinning trees.  Colorful leaves dominated the landscape except for the lone road leading from the elevator, and even that had a few stragglers that refused to budge.  As I looked, the slight breeze I heard rustling through the trees picked a few of the leaves and tossed them about.

I stepped forward and almost fell - I could hear //everything//.  The feel and noise of my clothes moving against my body was so unfamiliar as to be startling.  I could feel my muscles tense and relax as I moved them, my legs wobbling just a little bit from disuse.  I think I might have even been hungry.

The upper end of the elevator was not as zealously guarded as the lower - there was only one man here, and he looked somewhat surprised to see anyone arriving.  "Can I help you?"

He clearly did not want to help.

I didn't say a word, simply walked past him like I had all the time in the world and still couldn't be bothered to spare any for him.

His reaction was a shrug and a muttered "Your funeral, pal."  Not exactly what I was expecting, but I supposed the problem of tresspassers in New Providence was somewhat self-limiting.  I didn't dare think of how much time my trip would have already cost me had it not been paid for.

The forest remained a close companion for the walk, only occasionally breaking to reveal dirt roads vanishing into their depths.  Mailboxes ranging from immaculate to rusty adorned each road, though clearly those suffering from rust were doing so by intention of their owner.  Nobody who could afford living here would have to settle for rusty mailboxes.

An sign declared the road I was walking toward to be an intersection between Central and Prometheus.

Koloman's "house" was a three-story tall log cabin that was bigger than my apartment building.

Granted, that could not have possibly been true, but it was my first impression and it stuck.  It also gave me insight as to why wood paneling was so ubiquitous throughout New Detroit:  Bringing the real thing down to the motor city level of quality would have left little difference between the two.

An older man, burly but greying, stood anxiously outside the door.<<set $kolomanInPerson=0>>

:: koloman_noescape [conversation nocall]
I considered myself a good judge of character.  The ability to tell who's lying and who thinks they're telling the truth was a cornerstone of my business.  So it confused the hell out of me when Koloman appeared genuinely confused.

"I would not have done such a thing."  he said finally.  "I cannot speak with authority on what happened to you during our call, and I do not wish to call your judgement into question - that would bode ill for the both of us - but many who are recent uploads into our world suffer adjustment symptoms.  It may have been that."

When that answer didn't appear to satisfy me (because it didn't), he continued solemnly.  "I swear to you, <<print $gender>> Hallivert, I did not lock you in your room.  I want to hire a detective who is willing to take the case - more, who demands that justice be done.  If you are not that person, I'll not make you agree."

:: koloman_play [conversation nocall]
Koloman seemed surprised by the news.  "She always said she took inspiration from the dreams, but to create a play directly talking about them?"

"She can't be the only person to have done something like that."  I pointed out.

"She can."  Koloman replied strictly.  "She was.  Everyone else knew better."

I shrugged.  "I didn't."

"When Iva and I were first woken into the system, there were a series of tests to ensure our upload had been successful, that we had arrived with our minds and personalities intact.  Nowadays failures are so rare that they don't do such things, but they do listen.  If you went to your insurance company and told them that you'd dreamed during your upload, they would not believe you.  They would say it was an artifact of the upload or waking process, false memories created by your brain to patch over noise in the upload."

"I don't see how that would stop someone-"

"I am not yet done."  Koloman interrupted without rancor.  "People who are uploaded incompletely or incorrectly are often damaged psychologically.  Their condition can grow worse over time.  Often they are unable to adapt.  What I am telling you, <<print $gender>> Hallivert, is that if people believe that you are such a person, you may well find yourself committed to the retirement home."

I shuddered.  Based on my fairly limited information, it didn't have a terribly good reputation.  I decided to change the subject.  "Are the dreams real?"

Koloman looked distracted.  "I would once have said no, absolutely not, there are no dreams.  The words I said to you just then, explaining the false memories, they are the words the doctors said to me to explain my daughter's condition."

He looked back to me and spread his hands plaintively.  "But the impossible has happened, and so I must reexamine everything I once believed."

:: koloman_store_me [conversation nocall]
"Out of the question."  Nickolai answered automatically.

I paused, awaiting an explanation, and for a few moments it didn't appear as though I was going to get one.  Koloman looked at me and laughed.  "You're waiting for me to tell you why!"

"I assume there's some reason."  I replied blandly.

"I am incredulous because this is common knowledge, but again I must remind myself I hired you for your newness.  Storage is a one-way trip."  he answered simply.

"Doesn't sound that way."  I said.  "Iva got out."

Koloman nodded.  "Exactly my point.  She left storage, and she suffered nightmares, sleepwalking, delusions of dreams.  Her entire personality changed, she went from straight-laced accountancy to wild-spirit artistry."

"So it's a one-way trip //now//." I was beginning to see where my employer was going with this.  "To prevent that kind of thing from happening."  It sounded almost cruel - if Iva had been right, people were dreaming in that infinite storage.

"Not explicitly for that reason."  Koloman clarified.  "But yes.  Ostensibly, the reason is that voluntarily going into Storage is an important personal choice, one taken only when the simulation itself is no longer sufficient for life.  In this case, the only return is the Preservationist's fabled future where computation is so cheap that everyone can live in a New Providence-style simulation."

I honed in on the sole important part of his reply.  "Voluntarily?  What about the alternative?"

Koloman seemed confused.  "You mean running out of time?  Well of course, that happens, especially in New Detroit.  The minimum wage is one day per day, after all, which is only sufficient if you never take a day off.  And of course not everyone is careful with their spending habits."

* [[Point out that Iva probably wasn't the only one who dreamed|koloman_other_dreamers]]



:: koloman_other_dreamers [conversation nocall]
"No, of course not." Koloman waved the observation aside.  "It's recognized as a psychological issue, after all, those sort of things don't generally happen from a sample size of one."

"Do you think she sought them out?"  I followed up.

"I don't think she did, I know she did."  He frowned deeply.  "A few months after she moved to New Detroit, she returned for a visit.  She told me how her art was progressing and how the city was inspiring.  I didn't really understand how that could be the case and I don't suppose I do now, but what was important to me at the time was that she was finding a place for herself.

"She asked me, on that visit, if I'd ever heard of anyone like her, any early uploads who'd claimed to have dreamed.  At the time I assumed she was looking for something like a support group."  He leaned forward and wrote something on another business card and handed it to me.

"This is the name of the man I sent her to - he lives in New Detroit.  He worked as a counselor for new uploads back then, I do not know what he does now.  I hope he has answers for you."

"I don't even know how to do that."

He met my gaze briefly.  "More to the point, we've found that when we describe an area as full of deviants and perverts, that only makes people want to seek it out all the more.  Outright warning people not to go there has much the same effect.  It took us a long time and many harmed newcomers before we decided on our current stance of silence."

I frowned.  "I woke up at the train station."  It was a minor lie, and the PvP zones seemed like a tender subject.  "That's quite a hike from my apartment."

Guillory just nodded at this.  "That's far from the furthest that people have walked.  I once had someone come into my very office without realizing it.  It will pass, <<print $gender>> Hallivert."

:: koloman_whyme [conversation nocall]
Nickolai nodded at the question.  "A reasonable thing to ask.  There must be, you are thinking, many other detectives with more experience, and more knowledge of how the system functions."

I'd more been wondering which of my specific virtues he'd thought of when he called me.

Koloman continued talking.  "This is true.  You are inexperienced in this world and, compared to some of those here who have been investigators for over a century total, inexperienced at the job.  It is precisely for these reasons that I wish to hire you."

This was not a very good pep speech.

"I am not sure if you have noticed, but police presense in New Detroit is... nil, to put it nicely.  There are men and women who used to be police in their former lives, but most of them have retired.  There is no need to police when the simulation can do so automatically, with far greater coverage and effectiveness.  Hmph.

"What I am saying is that any overly-visible response such as hiring an expensive investigator would bring these men out of their retirement.  They have even less experience than you, but wield considerable clout.  They would make a show out of the investigation - moreso than it already is - and, I suspect, be ineffective at the actual investigating. 

"You, on the other hand, can ask questions in nearly complete freedom.  You are new to the system, it is expected that you will not understand it and will need to ask questions.  You have been assured of your immortality and yet seen someone stripped of that very guarantee.  Every act of investigation will be expected of you naturally."

I frowned.  "So does this mean I won't officially be on the case?"  I'd already seen what dropping Koloman's name could do in terms of getting people to co-operate; it was a powerful weapon I'd rather not be without.

"You will very much be on this case, <<print $gender>> Hallivert."  Koloman answered stonily.  "It will appear to the officials and gossips of this town that I am not taking my daughter's death seriously with your hire, and I am prepared to endure such accusations because I believe you will find me answers."

I found myself wishing that Samahd had been drinking something when I said that - his reaction indicated I'd have witnessed an actual spit-take.

"Koloman?  As in Nickolai 'more money than God himself' Koloman?"

I smiled a bit.  I hadn't thought I'd ever have been able to surprise Samahd.  "Or so he claimed.  This is his card."

The tour guide examined Koloman's card.  "Holy hell, that's his actual card!"

"I take it he's a bigshot?"

Samahd nodded.  "The biggest of shots, my friend.  Koloman Industries owns and operates the fabs that make half the hardware these sims run on.  Note that - sims.  Plural.  He lives up in New Providence on a //lifetime pass//.  And that's his new, non-mortal lifetime."

"I should take the job, then?"  I didn't think I really needed to ask the question, but Samahd surprised me.

"No.  Well, you should definitely go up there and listen.  If he's sponsoring you a free trip to New Providence?  Go just to experience it.  New Detroit will never seem the same.  But accept the job?  I wouldn't be so fast.  If someone rich as the king of bankers wants something from you and is willing to pay accordingly, it's going to be damn near impossible to actually do.

"I was a neurobiologist."

I'd been lied to plenty in my life, but this one very nearly took the cake.  "Bullshit."  I replied.

Samahd hoisted his glass.  "I swear upon this beer, I was a neurobiologist in life."  I was't sure whether his drinking the object of his vow invalidated it, but it didn't seem to stop him.

"But you're a tour guide."  I stated.  I began considering the idea that Samahd was actually independently wealthy and just showing newbies around as a form of slumming.

"I don't know if you follow the trade," Samahd replied in a tone that indicated he knew exactly how much I followed his trade, "but neurobiology is on the outs."

He started counting off reasons on his fingers.  "One:  The biology part.  The only part of biology you need is the part that makes the sensors for the brain-upload machines.

"Two:  The 'neuro' part.  All of that is done by computers pretty much exactly like the one you're currently in.  If you want to do research, you just get consent from someone who's already been uploaded and watch their brain do their thing.  You barely have to know anything about neurons or how they're connected because the machines take care of that.

"Three:  You can't do it from inside the machine.  At least not here in New Olympus; got outlawed sometime back, probably because someone wrecked someone else's brain or something.

"Four:  There's no money in it.  Once the technology got good enough to do a full simulation, why bother doing anything else?  You've got your AI researchers making better machine intelligences, but that kinda rules out biology by definition."

Samahd's omnipresent smile had actually dampened somewhat at this point, and he seemed to take a moment to put it back into place.  "Sorry if I sound cynical.  The ghosts of factory workers everywhere are laughing at me for being replaced by a machine, especially now that I am one.  I can't be too angry - the field used to be decently paying if not lucrative, and I could afford a few decades of afterlife, so it's not too bad."

Samahd looks dumbfounded.  "What, you'd been locked //in//?  So far as I know, that's impossible.  Well, it's impossible to get stuck either way when it comes to your own property.  Only person who could do that is Athena herself, and I doubt her holiness bothers slumming it on this level just to pull a few pranks."

"It happened."  I replied tersely.  I was getting a little tired of people not believing something I'd rather vividly lived through.

Samahd just shrugged.  "I've got an answer you're not going to like:  noob fever."

"What," I enunciated, "the hell," I added for emphasis, "is noob fever?"

My tour guide looked like he was debating between cracking up at this question and sparing me some dignity.  Fortunately for both of us, he chose the second option.

"Kinda a slang term, in case you hadn't figured it out.  And like I said, you're not going to like it.  But not everyone who uploads uploads... whole.  Used to happen a lot more often, when the system was new and parts were still experimental.  Still happens from time to time, though.  There are patterns in the brain that take a while to adapt to a simulated experience.  Like you've probably slept since you got here, right?  You don't need sleep, but it's so hardwired into your brain that it'll take you a few months to realize it."

"So sleeping makes you crazy?"  It was the most reasonable of the various ridiculous ideas floating through my head.

"Not what I'm saying, it was just an example of something that holds over from life.  Some folks, they still get hungry or thirsty for awhile.  But in some cases, it's worse.  Schizophrenia sets in for some folks.  Psychosis, agoraphobia, mania - depression too, but that's pretty treatable."

"So I'm crazy."  I was pretty sure I wasn't crazy, but wasn't that what all crazy people thought?

"Also not what I'm saying.  I'm saying it's a spectrum, okay?  It's called noob //fever// because, like a fever, it goes away.  People've come in to the sim ranting that the lizard people are the true masters of the world, and a few weeks down the line they'll be laughing about how utterly crazy that all seems now."

Even though I was utterly certain that I'd endured that strange episode in my apartment, it was still relieving to hear that, even if it was in my head, it was probably temporary.

He shook his head, still grinning.  Then, eyebrows cocked, he leaned in.  "No, the //real// answer that nobody else will talk about is the wrong side of the tracks."

I replied with my most bland look.  It's a trick in my arsenal that communicates a sentiment roughly equivalent to "you have given me so little information I can't even start being interested in what you're going on about."

"I know, I know, you want the real info.  And I know, I'm off hours.  But this one?  It would cost me my job.  Lemme just tell you that there's a reason the area has that name, and it's not just because it's across some railroad tracks."

<<endif>>"No, I couldn't!  It'd cost me my job.  Tour guide training specifically says not to talk about the zones.  And do you know why?"

"Because it's funny to them when someone gets mugged?"  I ventured.  "They're getting kickbacks from the robbers?"

"No."  Samahd replied.  "Because they want to project an image of family-friendliness onto this place."

"The very first place you took me to was a whorehouse, Samahd."

"It's a particular kind of friendliness, but you get what I mean.  The Power of Two's clean, everyone's there of their own volition, it's a good place."

He continued.  "The wrong side of the tracks, on the other hand, is full of people who want to hurt people and //know// that those people are getting hurt.  Also pain junkies, but those people just go to another bordello.

"You see what I'm saying?  Telling someone not to go into the PvP zone is pretty much like telling you not to go into the adult novelty shop and start hitting people with dildos.  It just ain't done in polite company."

Samahd lauged heartily.  "Lemme guess, people told you you're 'sleepwalking', right?"

I didn't bother trying to answer, because as usual Samahd had no intention of giving me time to.

"In their defense," he said, inventing imaginary virtues for the people he assumed had been talking to me, "they honestly believe that."

"And I take it that you don't?"

Samahd leaned in.  At this point I'd learned that this meant he was either going to tell me a secret or bullshit me, possibly both.

"It's not sleep //walking//, Hallivert.  It's sleep //teleporting//."

"Bullshit." That was an easy call.

"Oh?  How far did you walk?"

"Train station."  I wasn't about to confess to ending up in the PvP zones.

"That's not exactly sleepwalking into the kitchen, now is it?"

"Seems more plausible than teleporting directly there."  I countered.

Samahd shook his head.  "Does it?  This isn't the real world.  That's what you have to realize.  Your current location is just a couple of numbers in a computer somewhere - change those and boom!  You're somewhere else."

:: courthouse_exterior
The architects who created New Detroit clearly had an extremely generic template - the Courthouse could not have looked any more the part.  Faux-marble stairs, textured columns, even a statue of justice out front.

<<if $tourInProgress>>
"You probably will never see the inside of this place unless you decide to become a history buff." 
Samahd said.  "Used to be the center of law and order in this place, trials and everything, but it turns out it's easier just to make the sim so crimes can't be committed."

He pointed to the flat wall of a convenience store.  "For instance, say you had a spraycan and you felt like tagging your name all over that thing."  He rummaged through his pockets for a moment.  "Damn, I don't have one.  I usually bring one for this demonstration.  Anyway, it wouldn't work.  You don't own that store, you don't have permission to modify it, you can't do anything to it."

After a few more moments he pulled an ordinary-looking keyring from his pocket.  "I'd say 'at least I remembered these' but as it happens they're always with you.  They look like keys - old metal style keys, you've probably noticed the taste for antiques around here - and they act like them, letting you into doors, opening whatever you've locked, that kind of thing.  You've likely got one for your apartment."

Dubiously, I reached into my pocket and pulled out a keyring.  It had one key, featuring the number "1336" emblazoned on it.  I let go and the ring and key vanished.  Patting the outside of my pocket revealed nothing, but reaching in again resulted in the same key.  I hadn't even felt it there.

"A lot of abstractions work like that - your entry permissions being actual keys, the time-is-money concept being made into real bills.  New Detroit's got an old-time asthetic because there's no point in having it look technological.  We're not only surrounded by technology, we //are// technology.  No need to lug around a holographic projector for your phone when old-fasioned business cards can do the same thing."

He shrugged.  "You really do get used to it.  Anyway, come on, let's go get religion."

The fake-marble floor had no sheen and the supposedly regal-looking columns ended up looking more like oversized plastic toys.  The interior of the courthouse was little better than a stage set.  Come to think of it, I was pretty sure I'd seen plays with better production values.

A [[bored-looking man]] stood behind a plexiglass window with a speaker in it.  Seemed overkill for a universe in which he couldn't be hurt.

The basement of the courthouse looked more like the basement of a hospital than a police department or, for that matter, a courthouse.  A flat grey floor, walls tiled with those small square ceramics, foam drop ceilings.  I suspected that if I were in a better simulation that the old-style florescent lights would be buzzing.

A [[surly-looking woman]] was leaning against the wall.  Despite the fact that she was very clearly looking into the open door that lead into the morgue, I got the distinct impression she was watching my every move.

* [[Go to the morgue|morgue]]

:: morgue
The morgue was somewhat small, understandably.  It consisted of tile covering the walls, floors, and ceilings, and a single operating table in the middle of the room.

The utterly still body of Iva Koloman was on top of the table.<<set $seenIva=1>>
<<if $seenComaCarl>>I'd only ever seen one body as completely inert as this one - Coma Carl.  And Iva had been a regular visitor to the man.  My thoughts changed from the assumed homicide to virus.  Were computer viruses still a thing inside simulated realities?  Had Iva contracted something from Carl?

The fact that the uncooperative cop outside the morgue hadn't ended up in this state was a blow to the 'virus' theory, though.

"Yeah, and I'm-"

I never got to find out what imaginary historical figure he was going to compare himself to, because I'd held out the card and he shut up the moment he saw it.  I still had no idea how these people were verifying that these things were real; it seemed I could just get a blank business card of my own and write whatever I wanted.  Maybe it was just that nobody wanted to get on the bad side of someone like Koloman by forging their card.

"Holy shit!" the clerk let out a rare show of actual emotion.  "I mean, when the cops started coming out of retirement it was one thing, but Koloman himself is hiring people."  He let out a low whistle of appreciation.  "Man, better you than me."

He reached down and pressed a button on his desk.  There was a loud 'click' of unlocking from an otherwise completely unremarkable door at the other side of the lobby.  I was starting to understand the simulation enough to know that it hadn't actually unlocked, I'd just been given permission to go through it.  I bet that if I checked my keyring I'd find another bit of metal there.

Iva's body was still in a way I'd never seen anything behave before<<if $seenComaCarl>>, other than Coma Carl<<endif>>.  She was like a photograph - not only was her body not moving, but nothing about her moved.  Even the dress she was wearing was suspended in place.

I turned the seldom-used forensic portions of my brain on.  There were no cuts or bruises.  No sign of a struggle.  That said, she also didn't appear to have died in her sleep - her eyes were wide open and I didn't want to touch her to try to close them.  Her legs were ramrod straight next to each other and her arms had adopted a similar posture at her sides.  She looked like the most realistic mannequin ever invented.
<<display "morgue_actions">>

The clerk shuddered - one of the few genuine reactions I'd seen from him.  "You heard right.  The dead girl's in the police department."

He clarified after I gave him one of my trademark blank looks.  "Downstairs.  Courthouse is also a cop shop, not that there's much need for cops.  Point is, there's also a morgue down there.  Before this week I'd have told you there's not much need for that, too, but..." he trailed off, shuddering again.

"Can I-"

"No." he interrupted.  "Listen, today with this empty lobby and the one crazy guy who won't shut up - that's you - that's every day for me.  And as much as I hate it, I hated earlier this week even more.  There's one news channel on the TV because nobody cared enough to make more than one, but someone dies and suddenly everyone's a journalist."

"You looked bored."  I countered.

"To tears.  But I'm much happier dealing with one person than with a room full of wannabe reporters all trying to head downstairs.  Now I'm not saying you're some amateur like them, but I am saying you're not getting any further than they did."<<endif>>

"Peachy" the clerk replied.  There was a moment of silence.

"I'm sorry bud, but if you don't have official business I have to ask you to leave" he sounded genuinely apologetic.  I got the impression that this conversation, as bare-bones as it had been, had been a high-point of interaction for him.  "You're holding up the line."

I glanced back at a room entirely devoid of people other than myself.

"Yeah, I know." the clerk said.

The clerk leaned in.  "I can see why you'd want this job.  It's a very stimulating and challenging position.  Why just this morning I walked a lap of my entire office!"

The entire office was, maybe, four square meters.  At least his sarcasm seemed good-natured.

"I don't mean I want your job." I clarified.  "A job."

The clerk shrugged.  "They're all like this.  Courthouse here is mostly records and they're filed automatically.  I'm just up front because visitors like to talk to a human instead of a computer."

"Who am I?" this time she did look at me.  "Who the fuck are you?"

It took me a moment to realize this was not a rhetorical question.  "Sam Hallivert.  I'm a PI investigating the Koloman case."

The woman snorted derisively and went back to her previous stance of not looking my way.  "PI, shit."  She shook her head and did not explain her comment further.  I was pretty sure I wouldn't have liked the explanation anyway.

The policewoman rolled her eyes.  "Yeah, the dead girl in there must have just flipped her switch to 'off', what was I thinking?"

"People aren't dropping in the streets, this isn't like the real world, why are you here?"  I persisted.

"I came out of retirement because a girl's dead.  What more do you want?"

"And you're solving the case just standing there?"  I normally didn't let people get under my skin, but I couldn't resist needling her.

"Yeah, that's all I do, stand here waiting for idiots to come by."  Her eyes moved back to the interior of the morgue.  "I come here when I need to think.  When I need to remind myself why I'm doing this job.  I don't expect you to understand."

"Iva".  I said.

"Yeah," the sarcastic voice of the policewoman in the hall drifted into the room.  "Talk to her.  Maybe clap really hard next to her ear.  That'll wake her up."

I ignored her.  "Iva, your father hired me to find out what happened to you."

Iva didn't respond at all - her eyes stared straight forward, her body didn't so much as twitch.  I'd seen real-life dead people be more responsive.
<<display "morgue_actions">>


:: morgue_move
I put my hand on Iva's arm carefully.  It felt neither warm nor cold - instead it radiated the same textureless presence that I'd felt from the furniture.  Whatever had happened to Iva, the simulation was treating her body as little more than an object, and a poorly simulated one at that.

I tried to bend her arm up at the elbow and got no response.  I suspected that if I'd tried to push the wall the feeling would be exactly the same.  Her body was utterly immobile.  I didn't know how they'd moved it from her apartment to here and I didn't think the policewoman in the hallway would tell me.  It didn't matter - clearly, whatever happened to Iva, it was not natural.

"I swear to God," the policewoman spoke through grit teeth, "if Simon let a reporter down here I am going to hurt him.  I am going to haul him out of that dingy little office, drag his ass over the tracks, and punch him until he chokes."

I wasn't exactly sure how to respond to that, or even if it had been directed at me.  "I'm not a reporter.  I just want to get to the bottom of this."

Her hands had balled up into fists, I hoped unconciously.

"Or maybe it's that some innocent girl got killed because everyone thought it couldn't happen, and when someone actually tried to make a goddamn difference, they got nowhere.

New Detroit was a full-fledged city, and it was easy to forget that elsewhere.  Here, in the heart of the shopping district, it was obvious.  The hustle and bustle of human movement and conversation was more muted than it'd have been in the real world, but it still managed to be omnipresent.  And as in the real world, shopping seemed to be more popular than any other activity.

<<if $tourInProgress>>
"I wouldn't go on a spending spree right away!"  Samahd was having to speak up to be heard which, given the unrestrained volume he usually spoke at, was saying something.

He lead us toward a marginally more quiet corner of what was essentially a large strip mall.

"If you want to get a job, this is the easiest place to do it.  Some people order out of catalogs that act like the network-accessible shops you might be used to, but most people figure if they're going to get all old-timey, they're going to do it right.  In-person sales are pretty popular.  It only pays minimum wage - that's an hour per hour - but that'll extend you quite a bit."

He leaned back against the wall and people-watched for a while, which mostly forced me to do the same.  Shoppers here seemed focused and uninclined to talk, despite all the babble I heard in the air.

"Okay," Samahd was apparently done.  "enough regular people.  Let's go to the Arts District"

As though the door had been password-protected by just those words, it swung open.  A short olive-skinned man with dark hair and bleary eyes regarded me from the other side of the threshold.  "You're not a cop, are you?"

"No." I replied.  "Private investigator.  Iva's father hired me."

"I've been here less than a month."  I replied.  "Everything's weird to me."

"Yeah, but..." Emil changed tactics.  "Have you sleepwalked?"

<<if $accidentallyTeleported>>I nodded.  "I woke up in the PvP zone, of all places."

Emil cringed.

I shrugged.  "When I was a kid, a few times-"

"No, I mean, since you got here?  A lot of people, when they first get uploaded and they're still in the habit of sleeping, they sleepwalk."
<<endif>>

"Yeah."  I said.

Emil nodded.  "Iva sleepwalked //all the time//.  I mean, every single night that she slept - and she slept every night too, never broke the habit - she ended up somewhere other than where she started."

Was that the weird thing Emil was going to tell me?  It didn't seem that far-fetched.

"I'm not done."  Emil seemed intent on answering my questions before I asked them.  "She'd often call me when it happened.  I started getting suspicious one night when she called me from Bar Ocho."

"She was sneaking out to the bars?"  It wouldn't be the first time I'd seen that happen, but it didn't seem quite right for the simulation.

Emil shook his head.  "No, that's it.  She was in bed next to me.  I got up to go to the kitchen, and when I got back she's gone.  And seconds - literally seconds - later, she calls me."

"Bar Ocho's across town."  I stated the obvious just to make sure I understood.

"Yes, it is.  And it wasn't a prank call, she was really there, I went there and picked her up.  I cut across the hub and it still took me half an hour."

I nodded.  "I see how that's strange, but-"

"It wasn't the last time that happened.  I started paying attention to when she'd disappear and when she'd turn up, and it seemed like it took her almost no time at all.  So one night, as an experiment, I changed the door permissions so she couldn't leave."

I wasn't sure I liked the sound of that, but I motioned for him to continue.

"She knew."  he explained.  "I told her about the sleepwalking and she was excited, can you believe that?  She thought she'd stumbled on some truth of the system.  So she was on-board with the experiment, almost too excited about it to sleep so it could start."

"Let me guess."  I could see where this was going.  "The door didn't stop her."

"Nope."  Emil's nervousness seemed to increase as he told the story.  "She walked right out.  But that's the strange thing, I don't think she did walk out.  I mean, I remember that she walked out the door, but it doesn't seem right.  Not after what I saw later."

"So she got past your door security."  I tried to placate him and understand what the hell he'd just said at the same time.  "She'd hung out with hackers, maybe she picked up a thing or to, that's not so weird-"

"That wasn't the weird thing." he interrupted bluntly.

* [[Tell him to go on|emil_nervous_2]]



:: emil_nervous_2
"Go on, then." I said.  Now he really had me wondering.

"Over the next few nights we repeated the experiment.  She couldn't get into my apartment, the door would keep her out.  She couldn't leave the apartment if she was awake.  Just when she was sleepwalking.  And every time she did, my memory of her leaving the apartment gets a little fuzzier.  Once I opened the door after her to follow, and she wasn't there.  She was already at the insurance building."

"Okay, this is getting weirder."

"I told you about the last night I saw her, the night before she died."  it wasn't a question.  "I didn't tell you all of it."

"You were running the experiment?" I ventured.

"We were going to, but it didn't get that far.  That night, when we were going to bed, she said the last words she ever said to me:  "Wait, I think I've got this.""

I didn't comment.  If Iva had simply walked out on him right then it wouldn't have been that strange; he was going somewhere with this.

"She disappeared."  He held up a hand to forestall the objection I wasn't going to raise.  "I don't mean she walked out the door, I mean //disappeared//.  One moment she was standing there and the next she wasn't.  And when I remembered all the other times she'd sleepwalked... it was like I'd made them up.  Like they weren't real.  What I remembered now was that, every single time she'd gone out, she'd actually vanished.

"I didn't know what to think."  He added after a pause.  "I thought maybe she'd found some trick to make herself fall asleep instantly.  But she never called.  After a while I started looking..."

"And you found her at her apartment."

"It was the first place I stopped at." he acknowledged.  "And she was dead.  Completely still."  He looked up again at me, then away, as though he couldn't bear to look me in the eyes.  "I tell myself it wasn't my fault, my experiment didn't do it.  And lots of people sleepwalk, right?  I think the disappearing is a new wrinkle but on the other hand I think the 'walking' part might be something people's minds make up because the disappearing makes no sense."

He was right about one thing.  That was weird.

"Sounds like a bear."  I replied.  "Bear" was not the word I wanted to use, but for all I knew the cop was right.

"You don't know if she met anyone on the way..." It didn't sound likely, but I figured I'd ask.

Emil shook his head.  "No, she didn't meet anyone on the way."

"Who //would// do this?"  Emil was suddenly plaintive.  "I mean, why?  Nobody's died in this place in fifty years, and the first victim has to be my girlfriend?"

"In fifty years?  What happened before that?"  I asked.  I'd been under the impression that nobody had died, period.

"Iva told me."  He replied.  "She'd done a lot of research on the history of the sim.  She volunteered at the old folks' home, I think half to just get stories out of them.  Apparently things weren't stable in the early days and people could die due to glitches in the system."

He smiled.  "It's her story, you know."

"Iva wrote it, yes."  I replied.  I wasn't sure why that was important.

"No, I mean it's //her// story.  The evil king is Athena, and she's the dreamer.  She dreamed in Storage, she always said.  Nobody believed her, but I did.  It's what inspired her to make this play."<<set $ivaStorage = $ivaStorage + 1>>

He chuckled.  "Don't tell the troupe I told you this.  They don't want people to know the 'secret message' of the play.  Iva thought it was dangerous somehow."  His laughter died.  "Maybe it was."

"Koloman Theater" had obviously been built using Iva's funds rather than Nickolai's - it was a small and humble area.  If it had two dozen rows of seats I'd have been surprised.  Posters lined the walls - the same posters I'd seen back at Iva's house.  "Atlantis Rising" outnumbered the rest two to one.

On stage there was a worried group of kids - well, not //kids//, but that's the impression I got.  They were like kittens that had lost their mother - vaguely searching for something that had always been within reach, not yet realizing it was gone forever.

<<if $nftTroupe>>
The theater troop's reaction to my reappearance seemed divided.  On the one hand, most were happy to see me.  On the other, some were afraid.  Maybe because the fact that I was here meant that what had happened to Iva was real.  Maybe they just feared I was bringing them more bad news.  Either way, they were talkative.
<<else>>
<<set $nftTroupe=1>>
I made my way up to the stage.  The actors and actresses who made up the troupe seemed torn between practicing their play and the reality of what had happened to the woman who wrote it.  They didn't notice me until I hefted myself on to the stage.

"Who-"  The one I'd figured was the leading man spoke up.  His word broke everyone else's trance and suddenly the entire group was huddled together, watching me warily.

"My name's Sam Hallivert."  I said.  "I'm a private investigator working for Nickolai Koloman"

Their guard lowered, but not as much as that news usually did.  "Is this about what happened to Iva?" one of the women said from the back of the group.

"Yes."  I replied.  "I'm here to find out who did it, and how to stop it from happening again."  Brave words that I wasn't entirely sure that I could back up, but it didn't matter - the kids needed reassurance.

With that the group's guard lowered entirely, and they all spoke up in a babble; half directed at me and half among themselves.

The troupe introduced themselves at the same time, then tried to not introduce themselves at the same time, which resulted in a lot of people talking over each other.  It didn't really matter, it was easy to tell the relative hierarchy by who shut up when someone else talked.  I'd been right about the leading man, at least.

Eventually they got to the meat of my question.

"We're Iva's theater troupe."  The leading man said.  "She put us together a month ago after her trip off-grid, but most of us knew her before that.  I met her at the hacker's club."

"I was in her last play" the leading lady spoke up.

Again, a babble.  The group was all from the arts district, all New Detroit natives insofar as the term applied.

At least this time when the troupe answered all at once it was almost immediately understandable:  They'd seen Iva the week before she died, during rehearsal.  She'd left with her boyfriend, and she hadn't come back to the theater again.

The Arts District was Broadway.  As it turned out, that wasn't a metaphor - someone had taken the entire cityscape of New York's theater district, scaled down the fidelity, mixed it up a bit, and placed it in New Detroit.

I wasn't sure which, if any, of the details they'd gotten correct, but the neon lights were in fact bright.

<<if $tourInProgress>>
"Shopping's a good pastime, but if you want more classy sort of entertainment - well, as classy as you're likely to find in this city - the arts district here is the best place to do it." Samahd was standing in front of the Park Theater, which I'd been pretty sure had burned down centuries ago.  People were apparently not the only things that got afterlives.

"Prices here are pretty reasonable.  Your real theater snobs are all up in New Amsterdam at a far better rendition of this building.  This is bottom floor for artists of all stripes, so you can even catch free shows."

Finally, after what felt like hours of false starts, I got a word in edgewise.  "I suppose you can get hired on as an usher?"

Samahd laughed.  "Yes, actually.  Most people here are actors, painters, musicians.  Being an usher would be better work if you could get it.  Everyone wants to start a band but, well, you know the phrase 'starving artist'?  It somehow manages to be true even in a place where you can't possibly starve."

"Once you're finished with what passes for 'upscale' around here, I'll take you to where the real fun happens."

I followed the directions on Koloman's card to his daughter's apartment.  The arts district was almost uniformly full of people better dressed and less suspicious looking than I was, but I somehow managed to avoid attracting attention on my way.

Iva's apartment was in a building similar to my own, though only half as tall.

I felt like a voyeur, even though the woman whose bedroom I was peeping into was dead.  In contrast to the living room, the bedroom was clean and well-kept.  The bed was made, the clothes were in the closet rather than scattered about the floor.  I suspected that Koloman or someone else had tried to clean up a little - either that or the reason the bedroom appeared unused was that Iva had simply never used it.

I spent a few moments rifling through various drawers in search of a diary or something similar, but came up empty-handed.

The posters were for a number of well-known plays:  "Fiddler on the Roof", "Romeo and Juliet", "Babel is Ruined".

The fourth and largest poster represented a play I'd never seen headlining anywhere:  "Atlantis Risen".  Given that the poster proclaimed that it was to be presented by the "Koloman Theater Troupe", I didn't find it hard to believe that this was Iva's personal project.

More importantly, the poster had the address of the theater Iva's troupe was working out of.<<set $hasTroupeAddress=1>>

I'd thought the group had been effusive before, but clearly I hadn't found the right topic - until now.  Each member of the group shared their opinion of their producer, all at once.

"She was our stage manager" I managed to hear.  This was interspersed with "wrote the script", "artistic vision", and "kinda a tightass about scheduling" (though the last was said with a smile).

If Iva's killer had come from this group, they were by far the most capable liars I'd ever seen.

Absolutely everyone in the group named someone different.  Theories ranged from the generic "people in charge" to the specific "that bitch from the Holloway theater next door" to the crackpot "her dad, for the insurance money".

"We don't know."  The leading man finally said.  "I can't imagine anyone actually wanting to hurt her.  She had her rivals, yes, but even Holloway wouldn't //really// hurt her.  She just wanted to embarass her."

"Besides, Holloway got picked up by a patron two weeks ago.  She's been in New Amsterdam the whole time." another understudy said.

Iva's apartment was laid out almost identially to mine, with the exception that where my bed would have been, there was instead a door leading to a bedroom.

Another corner of the apartment featured a [[wooden desk|ivahouse_desk]] and chair - the sort of workstation I'd have set up if I'd known I was going back into the detectiving business.

The walls of the room were covered in [[posters|ivahouse_posters]].

The place was a mess, but there were no signs of a struggle.  Given the precarious pilings of books, papers, and other materials that littered the floor, such signs would have been extremely obvious.

* [[Go into the bedroom|ivahouse_bedroom]]
* [[Head back outside|arts_exterior]]



:: ivahouse_desk
There was not a single square inch of Iva's workdesk that did not host at least one paper.  Piles of looseleaf [[notes|ivahouse_notes]] made up the bulk of the mess.  A few books, scattered in no particular order or strata, were hidden beneath the notes.

The notes were hand-written and disorganized, but atop the pile of debris was a typewritten and loosely bound collection of paper.  It only took me a moment to recognize it as a [[script|ivahouse_script]]

* [[Turn your attention back to the living room|ivahouse_interior]]



:: ivahouse_script
The script was named "Atlantis Rising" <<if $hasTroupeAddress>> - clearly the play that the poster was created to promote<<endif>>.

I glanced through the pages:  The vague impression I got of the play was that its title was literal - Atlantis was a city "kept aloft by dreamers", but its corrupt king had convinced the populace that he was the one doing all the work.

I'd only been skimming the script, but as I went further more and more passages were blurred as through by a spill.  Some pages were entirely blank.  The script ended shortly after the intermission, with a dozen blank pages.

There was something vaguely unsettling about the missing portions.  They //should// have been there.  It was an assertion I had no way of proving.  For all I knew Iva had a bad habit of going up to the New Amsterdam beaches and making a mess of her script.  She might have inserted blank pages at spots she felt needed more work.

My mind came up with a dozen innocuous reasons for the script to be the way it was, and I knew all of them were wrong.

"Emil" the leading man said.  For once only one person had answered the question.  "He's not part of the cast, he's crew."  He glanced back to the group.  "We haven't seen him all week."

Before I could ask the requisite follow-up, one of the understudies spoke.  "He didn't do this."

The previous lack of babble and discourse ceased, and I was again awash in the sound of a dozen people talking over each other.  I got the gist very quickly:  Emil genuinely cared for Iva, he was happy being crew, he had no reason to hurt her.

"Can I talk to him?" I didn't yell, precisely, but this wasn't my first time on a stage.  I knew how to project.

The group seemed somewhat nervous about answering my question, as though they weren't confident that their words had swayed me.  If I hadn't had a character reference from Nickolai himself they probably wouldn't have, but in this case they were backing up what the old man had already told me.

Finally, they seemed to come to some sort of consensus.  The leading man faced me and answered:  "He lives in the next building down the street from Iva.  His apartment is 222."<<set $hasBoyfriendAddress=1>>

The portions of the troupe that had been sitting on the stage stood up at this, joining the rest of the group in trying to describe what the play was, until the leading man spoke over all of them:  "Storage."<<set $hasStorageReason=1>>

The quiet that came over the group was sudden and shocked, as though he'd broken some taboo.

"Nathan!" the harsh whisper came from the leading woman.

"I know, but it's important."  The leading man, apparently Nathan, replied.  He turned away from me to address the group.  "I know we're not supposed to talk about how that's the theme.  Iva even told us it was dangerous.  Well you know what?  Maybe she was right.  That's why the detective needs to know."

The group didn't seem entirely swayed, but they didn't voice any objections.  Nathan turned back to me.

I'd been glancing at the seafaring-themed posters of "Atlantis Rising".  "I don't see the word 'Atlantis' and think of Storage".  I said.

"It's a metaphor.  Atlantis is 'kept aloft by the dreamers', but a corrupt king takes all the credit.  Sound like anything you know?"

I shrugged.  I didn't see what any of this had to do with Storage.

Nathan failed to stifle a sigh.  "The dreamers are the people in Storage.  The corrupt king is you-know-who"  He pointed upward to indicate the upper levels.

"Nickolai?"  I played dumb.

He grit his teeth.  "No.  The goddess, the AI that runs this place."

"Oh, you mean Ath-"

"Shh!" he cut me off with more energy than I'd seen from anyone in the group.  "She can hear you."

I had no reason to doubt him, so I didn't press it. Instead I asked the other question that'd been bothering me.  "How do dreamers represent Storage?"<<set $ivaStorage = $ivaStorage + 1>>

Nathan hesitated.  The leading woman spoke up.  "You might as well say it, it's not like you haven't been blabbing secrets so far."

"Right."  Nathan agreed.  "The people in Storage dream.  That's what Iva always said, that her knowledge of the nature of the system came from her time in Storage, while she dreamed."

"Okay, I get that the play's a metaphor, but how is anyone else supposed to get that?  Everyone thinks that storage is inert."

Nathan shrugged.  "Not everyone.  Other people have come back from storage, and some of them dreamed, too.  To be honest, I don't think that Iva meant to convince anyone.  I think her aim was to //find// them.  Anyone who'd dreamed while stored would recognize the message of the play."

The Games District was obvious - it was surrounded by golf courses.  The sudden lack of buildings hanging over me gave me the strange fleeting feeling of agoraphobia.

<<if $tourInProgress>>
"If you haven't guessed why this is separate from the arts district yet," Samahd said, gesturing to the greens, "it's because it's about three times bigger."

We passed a few voleyball courts and a soccer field.  "Every sport on the planet is represented here, and some new ones that you can't do in the real world.  I wouldn't recommend starting with those, by the way."  He pointed to a three-story tall translucent cube that apparently featured rapidly changing gravity as a core game mechanic.

"You mostly see sports-style games because those take the most room."  He pointed toward a small building off the main road.  "That leads to the arcades, underground.  Every video game we could licence - and with the kind of money the architects were throwing around, it was a lot - is available there, 15 minutes per play.  It ranges from some of the more recent full-immersion games - much easier to play here than in the real world, you don't need a sim implant or anything - to old-style mechanical pinball."

"Take it from me," he came to a halt at the intersection, "your video game skills, if any, will carry over into this world, but your athletic skills won't.  I was a researcher but played softball on the side.  Couldn't play it at all once I got uploaded.  Game's the same, but you kinda have to re-learn your proprioception."

To call the outdoors 'sunny' or even 'well-lit' was of course a drastic overstatement, but the phrases didn't seem as wrong when compared to the grey interior of the Arcade.

The top level - which I was on - featured a lot of posters, maps, directions, and double doors.  It seemed almost like an airport:  advertisements for destinations and the companies that made them on every surface.  The hurry-up-and-wait pace of the many lines I'd seen formed only reinforced this idea.

A vertical slab of otherwise undecorated surface in the center of the room served as a map.  According to it, the lines were for the full-immersion games (a great deal cheaper here than on the outside, given that everyone was effectively already in one).

Beyond the crowds, toward the back of the arcade, was an elevator.  It was near-abandoned in comparison to the crush elsewhere.

The arcade's top floor had been mostly open area with a large number of side-rooms.  The professional gamer arena was entirely open.  Plain tables held computers ranging from ones so high-tech they'd possibly been invented after I'd entered the simulation to turn-of-the-century relics that I'd have expected to see in the museum one floor down.

Absolutely every chair was occupied.  Lining the walls were immersion pods - apparently if you were a pro-gamer you didn't have to wait in line above.  Every one of those was full as well.

<<if $investigating>>I spent some time walking around, looking for someone to talk to about the case, but reactions started at none whatsoever and got progressively more rude from there.

The "Hacker's Club" was a cramped lobby area that looked to have been copy-pasted from the insurance office's waiting room, complete with horrible wood paneling.  The only difference was that the friendly doorway to Guillory's office had been replaced with a large metal doorway with a sign reading "MEMBERS ONLY".

<<set $clubInPerson=1>>The Hacker's Club was a basement for some reason.  Folding chairs surrounded several folding tables.  Few electronic games were being played; instead I saw a number of board or dice games.  At least one group was involved in what I was pretty sure was some kind of pre-immersion Dungeons and Dragons game.  Two people off to the side were playing Chess, and not even the newer select-your-own-army version.

Chivaly stood on the bottom step, surveying the group.  Everyone seemed to be too enthralled by their gaming to notice.

"The Hacker's Club is almost as old as the simulation itself."  Chivalry seemed proud of this, though given her apparent age she probably hadn't even been conceived at the time.  "Back then it was more dedicated to its name, of course.

"Nowadays we're more of a social group.  We keep the older forms of gaming alive -" she gestured to the chess players, "and some of us come up with new things."  With that she indicated the roleplaying group.<<set $heardNoHacking=1>>

"Both, then."  She replied.  "Well, like I already said, I'm Chivalry.  I'm currently president of the hacker's club, five terms in a row, mostly because nobody else wants the job.  It's a lot of administrative work - running the cameras, keeping our paperwork intact, collecting dues.  Everyone's in this club because they want to game, not push paper."

"Hey!" I shouted at the door.  There didn't appear to be any security cameras in the lobby here, but somehow I suspected that actual cameras weren't required to see and hear somewhere else.

I took Koloman's card out of my wallet and held it up to the 'MEMBERS ONLY" sign.

"See this?" I said.  "I'm working for Nickolai Koloman, investigating his daughter's death."

There continued to be no reply.

"He thinks you did it."

The door opened.

* [[Enter the club|club_intro]]



:: club_intro [nocall]
Two large, angry-looking people were on the other side of the door to greet me.  Non-physical-world Gamers had a stereotype of weakness for over a century, but these two were doing their best to make up for lost time.  They were taller and stronger-looking than I was, and I'd been no slouch in life.

A woman stood between them, ignoring their presense entirely, instead looking at me.

"We didn't do it." she stated simply.

"I hope you realize I can't exactly take your word for it."  I replied.

She nodded and gave the bouncers a look.  They walked back into the somewhat larger room that formed the foyer of the club, but didn't take their eyes off of me.

"As a show of good faith." she said, handing me a card.  It read simply: "Hacker's Club".

<<set $cardHackers=1>>"My name's Chivalry." she motioned for me to follow her further into the club as she walked.  The greeters did not follow.

"Is that your actual name or like a gamer name?"  I asked.  My life had been a detective story, I hadn't found much of a need to play one in a game and so didn't know much about the culture.

Chivalry laughed quietly.  "Actual name, I'm afraid.  I think my parents meant to name me 'Chastity' or 'Charity' or something and got it wrong."

We walked for a bit.  The hacker's club was a long, nearly featureless, hallway so far.  Other than the greeters sitting on a bench by the entrance and Chivalry, I hadn't seen anyone else.

"Here we are." she said, pushing open a door I hadn't noticed.  Wooden stairs lead downward.

* [[Go down the stairs|club_interior]]



:: chivalry_nohack [conversation nocall]
Before Chivalry could answer the question, someone from the back of the room spoke up.  "Give him the flyer!"  A chorus of muted laughter went through the room.

Chivalry rolled her eyes, then explained.  "Sorry about that.  He's referring to our recruitment materials.  I don't think I actually have one with me, but one of the headers is "Why doesn't the Hacker's Club hack?""

"And why doesn't it?"

Chivalry smiled.  "Because it's illegal.  Something big went down early on in the sim's history - hacker's club wasn't even involved - and ever since then the gal upstairs has been restricting programming activity.  Got it all labeled as 'hacking'.  They say it 'undermines the stability of the simulation'."

"Wait, you can't even program?  Who makes the games?"  I gestured upward.

"Metaverse, mostly."  Before I could ask for clarification, she filled me in.  "That's another sim, full of programming types.  It's all allowed over there, but it's not exactly cheap.  Preservers will Store you for free, and getting a policy to set you up in New Detroit  for a few years is actually pretty affordable if you're not going to die for a while."

"Why not change the name?"  I asked.

Chivalry looked into the distance where the initial heckler's voice had come from as though to pre-emptively silence it.  Then she turned back to me.  "Yeah, that's in the flyer too."  She shrugged.  "The name's got a history.  We're not the same as we were, but it still means something to be a member of the Hacker's Club."

* [[You have more questions|convo_club]]



:: chivalry_iva [conversation nocall]
Chivalry smiled wistfully.  "She came down here same as you did, banging on the door saying she wanted in.  Didn't name-drop, though."

"Sorry." I wasn't, really.

"Don't be.  After what happened with her we haven't really been recruiting.  We wouldn't have let you in if you hadn't said who you were working for."

"Her death hit you that hard?"  I asked sympathetically.

"Yes, but that's not what I'm referring to.  She quit the club a month ago."<<set $heardIvaQuitClub=1>>

* [[You have more questions|convo_club]]



:: chivalry_why_quit [conversation nocall]
Chivalry's smile quirked.  "She didn't believe us about the hacking.  She came to the club thinking the whole "we don't hack" thing was a cover."<<set $heardNoHacking=1>>
"How long did it take her to realize you weren't kidding?"  I still wasn't entirely sure the excuse wasn't a cover myself.

"A few months.  By then, she'd made friends with everyone here.  It was a unique experience - we're a club for people who like to play games, and in comes a person who's incredibly creative but who's never so much as played checkers.  The old grognard types didn't like it, but everyone else?  Nothing they like more than showing a newbie the ropes."

"So what happened?"

"She arranged a field trip to Metaverse, and nobody wanted to go."

"Wait, nobody?"  I frowned.  Given the low production values of New Detroit, I'd figured anyone given a chance to get out would jump at it.  "I know it's pricey, but-"

"It's not the cost."  Chivalry said.  "Iva wasn't the kind of person who lorded their money over you.  She was the kind of person who wanted to use it to make things a bit better.  Paid more than her fair share for the club dues, bought rare games from off-grid, those sort of things.  So when she suggested the field trip, she made it clear she was footing the bill for everyone."

"And you didn't want to take a trip?"  I was aware that most gamers weren't exactly overflowing with wanderlust, but there was something else here.

"If she'd said Valhalla or Satya Yuga, I'm sure she'd have takers.  But Metaverse..." Chivalry made an uncertain gesture.  "It's got a reputation.  It's full of programming types, sure, but that includes the unsavory element, the people who think it's a blast to take down the whole system and make everyone have to get restored from backup.  It's bad enough we have to include 'not real hackers' in all our literature, to actually go to Metaverse where they all live and come back?  We'd probably lose our lease on this place, and that's for starters."

Of course, a more likely cause of my waking was the cast iron rotary phone sitting on the nightstand.  I was reasonably certain that neither the phone nor the nightstand had been present the evening before, but I couldn't really think very hard on the topic.

He turned to face down the road.  "For reference, this way leads back to the insurance offices, and over there leads to the neighborhood people around here call "The Hub".  It's an easy way to get across the city without having to walk through half the districts, but it's not on the tour because it's boring.  Keep in mind that this is a tour that features an insurance company, so when I say 'boring', I mean //boring//.

"And finally," with a deft twist of his hand, he produced a business card like the one Guillory had given me.  "Here's my card.  I like to keep in touch with the people I show around, and I'm always willing to answer questions.  Feel free to call anytime."<<set $cardFerro=1>>

"Sorry, don't mean to get all spookhouse on you, it's just the place has a bad reputation.  For the most part, it's full of people who've been in the simulation for a very long time, but for whatever reasons don't want to go into Storage.  Lots of people who were in the first wave of uploads, way back when.  It was more experimental in those days, and it didn't always work right.  Plus you've got the people who've got the double bad luck to have died bad and remember their deaths.  Physical trauma is a thing of the past if you stay on the right side of the tracks, but PTSD is forever."

He shook his head sadly.  "So yeah, the hospital look is not an accident."

"Of course, moving all the data that makes up a human being isn't exactly cheap, as you can see, and those prices don't include however much it'll cost to simulate you once you're there.

There were three of them that I could see - my hairless assailant and two others who must have come from behind as soon as I'd walked into their trap.

I clutched my arm around my stomach, trying to think and not vomit at the same time.  How the hell could this even hurt?  I was supposedly invulnerable.

This was punctuated with an actual kick to my ribs, laying me out on my side.  This was far from the first fight I'd been in, or even the worst, but my in-sim reflexes and heard-earned real-life combat skills had yet to meet.

The man behind me took my wallet, which was another thing I'd been pretty sure wasn't possible, and started flipping through it.

The third assailant hadn't said anything, but I saw surprise and sudden fear on his face.  He leapt toward me, his hand darting toward my mouth, but unfortunately for him I realized why.

''Iva Koloman Dead''

The announcer was doing his best to sound professional, but I could tell - he was at least a little bit rattled.

"To repeat, Athena has just confirmed with Motor News One that Iva Koloman is in fact dead.  Such a thing hasn't happened since the early days of our world, of course, and Athena stressed that - while she is still investigating - this is almost certainly an isolated incident.  Iva Koloman, 34, was found yesterday morning in her apartment by her fiancé.  The unresponsive state of her body and the system's inability to contact her lead many to speculate that she had died.  Moments ago, Athena confirmed this was the case."

Great, I'd died just in time for mortality to come to the afterlife.

"Understand," he started, "there's only so much I can tell you.  Even though I've left that life behind me now, I still adhere to confidentiality."

I nodded.  "I wouldn't have it any other way."  A lie, of course, I could use all the information I could get, but I knew when not to push.

"Well, then.  Iva came to me shortly after she'd moved here to New Detroit."  He trailed off.

"I hope there's more that doesn't fall under confidentiality."  I said wryly.

"There isn't."  He answered simply.  "The woman changed my life, and what I've told you is all I can say."

I was reconsidering my previous decision not to push when he continued.  "No, there is more.  I'm the one who got her her job."

"Writing plays?"  I asked.  I hadn't thought that was the sort of field that needed an introduction.

Marcus looked as confused by my question as I'd felt asking it.  "No, volunteering!" He clarified.  "She worked at the retirement home.  If you ask me, she was looking for more people like her, people who'd dreamed in their storage.  People who'd gotten locked up rather than pretend it hadn't happened."

I raised an eyebrow - that seemed like the sort of confidential information he'd just decided he couldn't give me.

"She never said that."  Marcus said in response to my unspoken criticism.  "And it's not a diagnosis.  Just a gut feeling."

"Wh-" was as far as I got before I felt an impact and explosive pain from my kidney.  A set of hands from behind me grabbed me by the collar and held me up.

The neo-nazi still in front of me shook his head amusedly.  "I love the smell of newbie in the morning.  Your wallet, that's what.  Hand it over."

Marcus nodded, then seemed to reconsider.  "Well, not anymore.  I was Iva's counselor, but that young woman made me reconsider the career."

"I heard she wasn't easily swayed from the dreaming thing."  I replied.

Marcus laughed.  "It wasn't just that!  Though you are right, I couldn't sway her.  In the end, she's the one who changed my mind."

I had no trouble believing this - she'd enraptured an entire theater ensemble, after all.  This man had supposedly been a professional but that word didn't seem to mean much in New Detroit.  "So you believe she dreamed in storage."

"No."  He corrected himself again.  "Well, yes, I do, but more importantly," he leaned forward. "I believe //I// may have dreamed in storage."<<set $heardMarcusDreamed=1>>

Marcus shrugged.  "I'm not sure how much I believe it anymore, but I've got the official word memorized if you want to hear it."

I motioned for him to continue.

He took a breath.  "There are actually two kinds of storage - short term and long term.  Long-term storage is what most people think of - your entire mind is written to a few redundant tapes and shipped to different regions for backup."

"Did you say tapes?"  I knew that New Detroit's whole theme was old-fasioned, but I had no idea that extended to their backup technology.

"Oh, yes.  According to what I was told, tapes are more reliable, take up less space, and have decades of shelf life."

I wasn't sure I believed it, but I wasn't an expert.  I didn't think Marcus was either, but I'd asked him to parrot the company line and I was clearly getting what I asked for.

"Anyway, that's long-term.  Short term is your ordinary computer storage that you'd save stuff off to.  It's on-site - in case you change your mind or circumstances change or they need you for some reason.  Doesn't happen much, but it's part of the system that's been in place this whole time so they never got around to replacing it."

Marcus laughed.  "That's the question, isn't it?  I can give you the company line, if that's what you're looking for."

"I'd like the truth." I answered simply.

"Wouldn't we all?  But honestly, at this point, I've got no goddamn idea what the truth is.  I can tell you what the company line is, and then I can tell you what I think."

I nodded.  That was enough for me.

"Okay, official statement:  The human mind was not meant to be stored or, for that matter, uploaded."  he began.

"Hold on."  I hadn't meant to interrupt this early, but already this wasn't making sense.  "This whole sim was made by Preservationists, right?  Isn't their whole philosophy about how we're all meant to ascend this way?"

Marcus blinked at me as though this was a total non-sequitur.  "Uploads pre-date this sim, <<print $gender>> Hallivert.  The official line I'm giving here isn't Preservationist."

"Ah, continue."

"Anyway, the mind's not meant for storage or uploading.  To clarify, I don't mean this in a //moral// way, just in a the-brain-never-evolved-for-this sort of way.  Same reason there were so many car accidents near the turn of the century, the human brain was never meant to comprehend travel at hundred kilometers an hour."

"You don't have to tell me."  I replied.  "That's exactly how I got killed."

"But the brain is nothing if not adaptable.  So in the face of something it cannot understand, like uploading, it will invent something that makes sense.  For many people, especially those who first were uploaded, that something was dreams.  They hadn't //died//, they'd merely fallen asleep for a time.  Much easier to understand."

"They remembered dreaming."  I pointed out.  Somewhere in Ivy's notes had been a half-organized dream journal, though I hadn't checked to see if it dated back to before she'd been pulled out of storage.

"Memories are lies, <<print $gender>> Hallivert.  It's something the psychological community has known for over a century now.  It's shockingly easy for someone to remember something that, simply put, never occurred.  As an example, doctors had to be careful not to accidentally implant memories in their patients, and this was in the days //before// fully-immersive environments."

I thought on this for a moment, then changed the subject before I could start doubting my own memories too much.  "You said you'd tell me what you thought, too."

Hallivert smiled weakly.  "I do not know.  It may not sound like much, but you did not know me as I once was.  Strong, certain that I was in the right, that I was helping people get past the false memories of Storage.  To admit that I do not know... it puts my entire life's work in question."

"Why of course!"  Marcus seemed surprised that I hadn't already realized that for myself.

"Do you believe they were real?"

Marcus shrugged.  "I'm a lot less certain of their falsity than I once was."

"What were they?"

I'd asked Marcus a number of questions at this point, and he'd been open and vaguely friendly the entire time.  This question he shrank from, as though I'd suddenly touched a hot iron to his arm.  He shook his head emphatically.

"I was a psychologist in life, as well."  He said finally.  I wasn't sure if he was reluctantly answering me or changing the subject.  "So when I came to this world only to be told that I had myself suffered a delusion, well, it was music to my ears!"

"That's probably not a common reaction."  I commented.

"No, indeed.  I could recognize the dreams for what they were, though - the false memories the unconscious parts of my brain generated to bridge the gap between my last life and my current one.  But I was fascinated by this expression and all the other side-effects of early upload.  So I changed my specialty, became the counselor that Iva saw."

There was a long pause.

Marcus nodded, no sign of his earlier anxiety over the topic.  "I suppose..." he said slowly.  "Though if it kills you like it did her, I'm never saying anything to anyone ever again, do you understand?"

I did, all too well.  I was following in Iva's footsteps, and they'd lead down a dangerous path.  I could only hope that this wasn't the particular fork that'd killed her.  I motioned for him to continue.

"I was never supposed to come out of storage."  He began.  "At least, not until the promised day of the Preservationists.  My husband - Jacob - and I had insurance policies that guaranteed us a spot in Storage.  He was the actual believer, I simply signed up to make him happy and in case it turned out to be real."  He gestured around himself.  "Good thing I did, hm?

"I died, and they put me in storage.  Jacob died about five years later, but something went wrong with the upload process.  More wrong than usual - he was... corrupted.  They couldn't re-build his mind on this side."

I nodded.  It seemed there was more than one reason that Marcus had gone into upload-related psychology.

Marcus was too involved in telling his story to notice my reaction.  "There was a civil suit by his next of kin - his brother.  I was called on as a witness, though even now I don't really know why.  But they pulled me out of storage to testify.  After the settlement, I could afford to live here in New Detroit.  Hell, I could afford to live in New Phoenix, but... well it's less real down here.  It hurts less."

He paused, a sad remembrance over his features.  I got the feeling I was dredging up memories he hadn't reflected on in a long time.  I tried to change the subject "And the dreams?"

Marcus sighed.  "The dreams.  I died in a hospital - I was a smoker, if you can believe such a thing still existed.  So when I woke up in the hospital, I didn't even know anything was wrong.  The first clue should have been that I could walk.  The second clue should have been the fact that I didn't need to breathe.  But I didn't even think about those things, because it's a dream, you know?  You don't question a dream unless you've trained yourself to.

"I didn't recognize anyone.  The doctors were different, the patients were different.  Jacob, who'd never left my side in those last hours, was gone.  I walked unfamiliar floors in an unfamiliar layout.  I was in a hospital, but it wasn't mine."

He glanced up at me.  "Later, after they woke me up, I worked at the retirement home.  It was the place I'd dreamed.  At the time, I rationalized it, I let myself believe that I'd planted the false memory of the retirement home in my mind.  But now?"

He shrugged, looking away.  "I don't know what to believe.  Did I dream a place that not only had I never seen before, but wasn't even real?  I couldn't have.  It's impossible."

He turned his eyes toward the television.  "But I saw on the news about Iva.  The impossible's already happened."

I crossed the tracks and the trademark dread of the PvP zone settled over my mind.  Now that I knew what it was it was a lot easier to handle.  The fear I'd first felt on entering was a dull sensation of unease in the back of my mind.  I could deal with that.

* [[Continue down the street|pvp_street_normal]]<<else>>
The moment I crossed the tracks, I knew I'd made a mistake.  Somewhere in the back of my mind, fear started to creep in.  It was formless, aimless, and sourceless, but it was real and suddenly almost overpowering.  I wasn't someone who scared easily, but this was something else.

The streets around me were empty.  There was absolutely no reason to feel this way.
