The afterlife had wood paneling.

It'd ordinarily be an absurd thing to notice.  I was dead, after all, in the hereafter's own waiting room.  You'd think there'd be pearly gates, or at least a hint of brimstone, but instead?

It was a waiting room.  Wood paneling on the walls, an oblong receptionist counter complete with bored-looking [[receptionist]] doing her best not to make eye contact... it was only missing some out of date magazines and it'd be perfect.  I'd have to mention it to whoever ran the place.

* [[Wait|intro_wait]]


:: receptionist
I made my way up to the receptionist.

"Sam Hallivert" I said.  "I suppose I have an appointment?"

The receptionist looked up at me as though I was barely more interesting than the game of solitaire she'd been cheating at.  "Not as such, no."  She went back to the game.

I waited for her to continue talking, and she waited for me to sit back down.  She had the advantage of long hours' practice at ignoring waiting rooms, but I was dead.  It wasn't as though I had anywhere else to be.

She looked back up.  "Mr. Guillory will see you as soon as he is available.  Please wait your turn."

I glanced back at the row of four seats that apparently sufficed as a waiting room.  Without me there to provide bulk, they were empty.  I opened my mouth to-

"He's with a client."  the receptionist said before I could even turn my head back.

I nodded.  She'd won this round.<<set $guilloryPhone="Test">>

:: intro_wait
I was expecting the seats to either be uncomfortably thin or absurdly over-stuffed, in the style of waiting room seats everywhere.  These looked thin but didn't feel it.  They didn't feel like much of anything, to be honest.  I could have been sitting on a box and leaning against the wall and gotten more of a sensory experience out of it.

That I was reduced to mentally critiquing the furniture indicated a lot about my [[mental state|intro_mentalstate]].

* [[Wait|intro_invite_in]]


:: intro_mentalstate
Some part of me kept insisting that I ought to be panicking right now.  I was dead, killed in the prime of my life by...  well, I couldn't remember how I died precisely, but I didn't really feel like knowing the grisly details of my demise at the moment anyway.

The point was, I was dead and I ought to be upset by it, but I couldn't find it within myself to really care that hard.  Obviously, there was an afterlife - I was in it.  The fact that it lacked a certain polish was a minor detail.

:: power_of_two_exterior
"The Power of Two" sounded like it ought to be a bordello, and as I got closer to the building I could tell that this impression was, if anything, understated.

Posters of naked women covered every available surface of the building, in many cases obscuring each other and in some places overlapping with the neon sign naming the building.  A very few ordinary signs were visible:  One proclaiming "Titanic Tits!" and another in much smaller type explaining that the cover charge to enter was 1 day.
<<if $tourInProgress>>
Samahd gestured to the display and wiggled his eyebrows suggestively.  "I'm not here to judge!".

Grinning, he donned his tour-guide voice.  "This, as you've probably guessed, is New Detroit's premiere whorehouse.  Athena - that's the AI that runs this sim - doesn't let people just turn their brain's pleasure center on and ignore the world, so sex is still very much a thing!  It's got some benefits over the real thing.  No diseases, nobody can possibly get pregnant, nobody's forced into it because you can't be forced into anything here - it's pretty much the best brothel ever, anywhere."

He shrugs.  "That's the official line, anyway.  It's kinda pricey for my taste.  Head up this way and I'll show you my hangout."

The door finally opened, and a bespectacled man in his early forties stepped out, holding a manilla folder.  Wherever I was, it was decidedly low-tech.

"Sam Hallivert?" he said, looking up and meeting my gaze.  He at least had the dignity to look slightly embarassed at asking a question with an obivous answer. "Ah.  Right this way, if you would."

* [[Follow him|intro_guillory]]


:: intro_guillory
What choice did I have?  As strangely at-peace as I was with my current morbid state of affairs, I still had questions. "Alex", as his gilded nametag proclaimed him to be, presumably had answers.

He turned back through the door, and I followed.

I'd been expecting a doctor's office - as much or as little as that made sense for a dead man - but what I got instead was "insurance agent".

<html><div class="center">
Alex Guillory<br/>

"Put your life in our hands"
</div></html>

I frowned at the desk plaque as Alex moved behind it and took his seat.  Insurance?  It was naggingly familiar and utterly bewildering at the same time.

If Guillory noticed my reaction, he didn't say anything.  Instead, he gestured toward the seat behind me - identical to those in the waiting room, so far as I could tell - and said "Mr. Hallivert, please, have a seat."

Guillory looked at me for a moment, then back at his folder.  Finally, shaking his head as though to clear it, he took a pen and made some note I couldn't see from my vantage point.  "My apologies, Ms. Hallivert, there was a mistake in our files.  Please take a seat."

* [[Sit down|intro_questions]]

Guillory launched into what I could tell was a well-recited speech.

"<<print $gender>> Hallivert, I'm sure you have many questions, and this entire experience is likely very disorienting for you.  However, to best help you through it, I'd like to ask you a few questions.  Is that acceptable?"

Guillory was either unfamiliar with the tone or completely unimpressed by it.  "I can imagine so, but it really is to help you."

* [[Answer the questions|intro_question_1]]
* [[-- No, you answer my questions|intro_interrupt_2]]

I nodded, supressing a weary laugh.  "Yeah.  I'm dead."

Guillory put down the pen and nodded, seemingly relieved.  "Ah, yes, that is the case.  I am glad that you've already realized it - many people, even after being briefed, take quite a while to come to that conclusion."

He paused for a moment, smiling, but then suddenly seemed to remember he had work to do.  "Are you ready for the next question?"

* [[You're ready for the next question|intro_question_2]]

I did my most convincing I-don't-know-nothing shrug.  "You tell me."

Guillory made a note in the folder.  "Ah, I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news then.  I'm afraid you've died."  He followed this up immediately, as though afraid I was about to erupt in emotion.  "There's nothing to be worried about, you're fine now!  As I'll explain, you have a new life now with us, and it's every bit as full of potential as your last."

He studied me for a few moments.  "May I ask you another question?"

:: insurance_exterior
I stood in front of the Life Preservers Insurance building - a middling grey cube in the sea of middling grey cubes that apparently made up this place.  It was dark - and I very quickly got the impression that it was always dark - but surprisingly quiet for a modern city.  No horns blared, nobody yelled from the window of their car.  There didn't appear to be any traffic whatsoever, that I noticed.  A few people trudged by now and then, silent in their contemplation or more likely spending all their mental energy on gathering the willpower necessary to take another step.

For the center of the city, this is an extremely sparse area.  Roads from every corner of New Detroit converge in a circular plaza utterly lacking in any decoration at all.  They could have at least put a fountain or a statue in the middle.

:: bar_ocho_exterior
Bar Ocho looks like someone took the platonic ideal of 'Bar' and copy-pasted it into the city.  Considering the fact that this was a simulated city, that might not have been too far from the truth.  The name of the bar was in neon, as far too many building signs seemed to be.  The "O" in "Ocho" was overlaying a large stylized 8-ball.  I found myself wondering if anyone played pool in New Detroit.

<<if $tourInProgress>>
Samahd stood to the side of the bar's door.  "For future reference, this is where I am on almost all of my downtime.  I mean, I'll give you my card at the end of the tour, but not everything is business, right?  Sometimes you need to unwind.  That's what this place is for!  The beer's not as effective as on the outside, but the upside is that you can't become addicted to it.  Simulation doesn't allow it.  Great, huh?"

He gestured up to the non-buzzing neon sign.  "Oh, another thing.  See that sign?  That's a pun in my language.  'Borracho' means 'drunk'.  Despite the America-centric theme of the city names, there are more languages spoken here than in any other one place on earth.  Turns out translation is only hard for computers when they don't have full access to the mind-state of the people doing the talking.  So if you never got to learn another language in your previous life, don't worry!  You'll never need to!"

He stepped away from the door and started walking up the street, pointing to a large vertical column in the distance.  The slightly glowing blue cylinder was far taller than any other building - or anything I'd ever seen in either life.  "That thing is our next stop."

I shrugged.  I'd gathered I was dead, that the afterlife was poorly decorated, and that angels (or devils, the state of my soul was still up in the air) had names like "Alex Guillory".  Everything else was news to me.

Alex made a note in my file and nodded.  "Memory can take a while to be re-accessible."  He closed the folder and looked up at me.  "Well, I have answers."

He gestured around himself, indicating that I should take in the room.  There wasn't much to see - the same faux-wood paneling on the walls, an uninspired plastic desk, the job plaque I'd noted earlier, a cup of pens.

I'd been a private investigator in my previous life, though, so I also noticed what wasn't in the room.

Guillory's desk only had his plaque, the pens, and the manilla folder.  There were no ports to plug anything into, and no ports for output.  The holographic projection interface you'd need if you wanted to use the desk for anything other than putting things on was conspicuously absent.  The desk was either a great deal less advanced than the desks I was familiar with, or a great deal more.

Now that I was thinking about plugs, ports, and electronics I noticed more:  There were no electronics at all, and the corresponding places where they'd interface were also missing.  No charging stations.  There wasn't even a light switch and, now that I was looking, no /light/.

I frowned at the last observation.  The room was lit perfectly - there weren't even shadows.  I'd say it was impossible but I'd already done one impossible thing today just by being here.

* [[Mention the strangeness of this place|intro_bridge]]


:: ferro_tour_accept
<<set $money = $money - 7>><<set $tourInProgress = 1>><<set $ferroInPerson=1>>I looked through my wallet and discovered I had exact change.  Hoping this worked like it did in the real world, I took seven days worth of bills out and handed it over to Samahd.  He smiled and took it, so I must have done something right.

"All right, let's get started!  Let's see, basic information you need to know:  This is New Detroit, the lowest level of the simulation.  You've probably noticed all the lack of amenities - no shadows, no smells, no heat or cold, sounds don't travel far, lots of things lack texture - you get used to it.  You probably wouldn't even have noticed if I hadn't pointed them out." He grinned prankishly and started numbering things on his hand.

"First, you can't die here."  There was something in the tone of his voice when he said this, but as usual I couldn't get him to stop long enough to ask.  "Where would you go, right?  Second, you can't be hurt here unless you go into the wrong neighborhood - and you'll know it if that happens.  Third, you can't be robbed - other people can't even //see// your wallet, let alone take anything out of it.  This Detroit's a lot safer than the real one, if a lot less scenic."

"Fourth:  Don't run out of time.  That's a one-way ticket to Storage.  I'd recommend getting a job - even one that pays one day per day is a pretty good gig, keeps you going."

Samahd looked down at his hands as though he'd forgotten something, then shook his head to dismiss it.  "Anyway, enough about the new motor city in general, let's get specific."

He smiled his tour-guide smile and gestured to the Insurance building behind us.  "This, as you're probably already aware, is the Life Preservers Insurance building.  Drop-off point for new uploads fresh off the bus.  They've got customer service agents always ready to talk, they sometimes help with job placement if you're willing to pay for it.  Kinda self-defeating if you ask me, but hey, whatever works."

"Up this way is the Power of Two."  Samahd started walking up the street.

:: intro_bridge
"This place is no insurance agency, that's for sure."  I said, gesturing to his plaque.

Guillory chuckled.  "Actually, we are."  Opening the folder again, he pulled out a rather large bundle of paper, stapled together.  I hadn't remembered the folder holding that much, but I didn't get the chance to ask before Guillory turned the paper to face me and put it down on the desk.  "This is your policy."

I wanted to ask Guillory for clarification, but I had the feeling the policy would speak for itself.  Unsurprisingly, it was by the same naggingly familiar "Life Preservers Insurance" and seemed to be pretty standard legalese.  I was about to give up and simply demand an answer when a portion caught my eye.

<html>
<blockquote>
<p>17.  Consent for medical implant.</p>
Participation in the Program requires consent to implant a medical device (colliq. "a soulkeeper") into the brain for a time no less than seven years.

Guillory must have been watching for me to get to exactly that part.  "Before you become worried, you are a successful restoration.  I suspect you have many questions."<<set $heardOfSoulkeeper=1>>

He finally seemed to get the message that I wasn't feeling like playing his game, but to his credit he didn't let it creep into his voice.  "Very well," he said.

<<display "real_convo_guillory">>


:: guillory_whatnext [conversation nocall]
Guillory smiled widely.  "That's entirely up to you.  You have most of another whole life ahead of you.  Many of our clients dedicate themselves to art, or mastering a skill that they lacked in life.  Many others simply lie back and relax, treating this as an extended retirement."

He gestured down to the sheaf of paper on his desk that was my insurance policy.  "The policy you purchased in life gives you fifty years of New Detroit time - more specifically, a little over three million seconds subjectively.  Time flows a little bit differently from city to city, but nothing you'll notice unless you spend a while there, and should you be able to afford that you'll likely have more time than you need anyway."

"Afford?"  I looked at him skeptically.  There was always a catch.

"You've no doubt heard the phrase 'time is money'?  Well here it is literally true.<<set $heardTimeIsMoney=1>>  What your policy paid for is enough computing power to simulate you for fifty years at the level of fidelity that New Detroit offers.  That money on the outside became time here.  Time here is a valuable and scarce commodity that cannot be counterfeited.  Your fifty years is currency - a fair bit of it, actually.  I would advise you not to spend it all in one place."

* [[You have more questions|convo_guillory]]


:: guillory_upload [conversation nocall]
"The process is very technical" Guillory literally handwaved the response.  At least he had the decency to almost immediately realize that I wasn't going to find that a satisfactory answer.

"Well," he began again, "your soulkeeper <<set $heardOfSoulkeeper=1>>is extracted after your death.  Its patterns are fed into the large banks of machinery that make up this world, and those computers then add your mind to its simulation."

"Simulation."  I said.  Suddenly the copy-and-paste furniture made a great deal more sense.

"Yes.  I don't know your religious leanings, <<print $gender>> Hallivert, but this is not a spiritual afterlife.  You are currently within the memory and processors of nearly five thousand top-of the line servers at a data-center in Boulder City, Nevada."

"The Soulkeeper is you - at least, the you that you are now."

Guillory saw my nonplussed expression.

"Well, it's a bit more technical than what I'm about to describe, but simply put, the soulkeeper contains a few hundred billion tiny machines.  These machines are very small - the term 'microscopic' is too large, to give you an idea - such that all these machines can quite easily fit within your head."

I didn't like where this was going.  Obviously I couldn't argue the end result, but the process was already sounding very uncomfortable.

The insurance agent seemed to notice my discomfort.  "It's actually quite noninvasive.  The machines are smaller than even your own brain cells.  That's their job, after all - once implanted, each device finds a nerve to latch on to.  From there, it goes about recording everything.  What causes this nerve to fire?  What levels of neurotransmitters are present at the time it does so?  When does this nerve die, and if this happens what is the cause?  Is there a replacement?"

"So they learned how to be me."  I observed.

Guillory nodded.  "Exactly!"

:: guillory_insurance [conversation nocall]
The question made Guillory smile.  "That's somewhat of our mission statement."

"Life Preservers Insurance," he said with the same air of rehearsed speech he'd had earlier, "was founded to provide people with policies that could be used to keep them alive in this simulation after they'd passed on.

"That is somewhat of an important point - we are not a traditional insurance company.  We do not insure houses, or health, or even life in the usual manner - though much of the funding that finances your part of the simulation is derived from a life insurance policy.  Instead, we're an insurance company dedicated to getting people to the /next/ life.  This life.

I'd thought the receptionist was bored and lazy - the sort of person who gets a job because they want to pay the bills, not because they particularly have any passion for the job.  I quickly discovered I was wrong.

The receptionist's true motives for taking the job appeared to be because it gave her the occasional chance to do what she did just then - leap from her desk and interpose herself bodily between me and the half-door.

He smiled welcomingly as he caught my gaze, and had closed the gap between us before I could even say a word.

"Samahd Ferro, Tour Guide." he said.  "I've got other titles - welcome wagon, noob patrol, New Arrival Emotional Well-Being Adjuster - it's just that the 'Tour Guide' thing is the most honest.

"Anyway," he continued, not letting me get a word in edgewise, "it's my job to give new folks like yourself an overview of the area.  I mean, you probably got the basics from one of the stuffed-shirts inside, but it's one thing to know you live in a city, and another thing to see it.  What do you say?"

"Not exactly."  Now that a less professional topic such as religion had come up, Guillory looked a lot less comfortable.  "This company was founded by the Preservationist movement, of course, and a fair amount of stock is still owned by the church.  But-" he held up a finger to stress the point "we don't require that our clients adopt, share, or even entertain such beliefs.

"Obviously, believing that people should be preserved after they die and working at an agency like this are quite compatible.  Similarly, those that believe in a non-digitizable soul that they will take with them to a true afterlife are unlikely to sign up for our services.  Still, we are open to all."

A vague grimace game over Guillory's face.  "It's not a scenario we like to discuss - nothing terrible!" He rushed to reassure me despite the fact that I hadn't appeared surprised at all.  "Anyone who runs out of time is simply downgraded to Storage.  We're Preservers, after all<<set $heardOfPreservationists=1>>, we're not going to just delete someone."

Despite the calming tone, I didn't like the sound of Storage.

Guillory had anticipated my next question.  "Yes, Storage is what it sounds like.  Your patterns that are currently in simulation now are stored on disk - and also redundantly backed up, of course.  You will no longer be simulated, but of course it's the Preservationist belief that eventually simulation costs will be so low that everyone can be revived for free.  At that point, you'll be returned, likely to this very office."

Guillory consults his notes.  "Looks like you were struck by a car?"  his voice radiates confusion.  

"I got run over?"  I asked.  It was absurd - cars had dozens of redundant systems designed to prevent the computers that drove them from hitting people.  You could walk across a busy freeway in complete safety, provided you didn't mind heading to court afterward and paying a hefty fine for disrupting traffic.

Guillory nods.  "Ah, here it is, you were struck by a //non-automatic// car.  Not a lot of people who don't have a self-driving car nowadays, but the hold-outs tend to be rather deluded about how good they are at driving."

I'd been under the impression that dumb-cars had been finally outlawed years ago.  I hadn't really cared about the issue at the time, and now it was quite obviously too late.

:: elevator_exterior
Every other building in New Detroit seemed to have been cut from the same block of concrete.  The Elevator was different.  A sleek blue steel column, it started from ground level and stretched upward into the sky.  I couldn't tell where - if anywhere - it stopped.

<<if $tourInProgress>>
"Yeah."  Samahd nodded.  "That's the Elevator, it's how you get to other cities in the same simulation.  It could have been an airport or something, but I think the people who designed it liked the Elevator metaphor.  They're above us that way."

He turned back to me.  "Like I said at the beginning, this sim's workable but missing some amenities.  Nothing here takes your breath away, right?"

I knew he used that phrase on purpose, because I noticed then that I wasn't breathing.  I hadn't been breathing the entire time.  I didn't think I //could// breathe and, most strange of all, this fact did not trigger a panicked choking for survival.

"Yeah, this stage of the sim, the city we call New Detroit, it's just above the brain-in-a-jar level.  You get most of your brain simulated but almost none of your internal organs.  Cuts down on the overhead of the sim, you can fit more people in cheaply.

"Ever have a dream that, when you wake up, you realize was utterly absurd?" Again, without waiting for an answer, he continued, "Why didn't you realize it in the dream?  I mean, four-armed gorilla monsters from space aren't even remotely real, but your dream-self doesn't question it.  It's the same thing here.  There's a part of your brain dedicated to constantly asking the question 'does this make any damn sense at all?'.  In dreams, it's shut off.  Here?  It's not even simulated."

He gestured back to the column.  "That's not the case everywhere.  The next city up is New Phoenix.  They've got shadows, better physics, more texture, better sound, but still no internals.  It's the same sim, keep in mind that this isn't taking you off-grid or anything, it's just that they dedicate a lot more computing power to NPX.  It costs a lot more too, though - the ratio of New Detroit time to New Phoenix time is about 50:1.  One day's vacation would cost you a couple months.  That scale's just about the same all the way up, too.  Next city's New Amsterdam, and that's fifty times more expensive than New Phoenix.  Top of the pack is New Providence.  It's fifty times more expensive than NA.  I don't know if you've done the math, but that means you could spend a lifetime in a few minutes."

He shook his head.  "Too rich for our blood, in other words.  Come on, let me show you the courthouse."

The architects who created New Detroit clearly had an extremely generic template - the Courthouse could not have looked any more the part.  Faux-marble stairs, textured columns, even a statue of justice out front.

<<if $tourInProgress>>
"You probably will never see the inside of this place unless you decide to become a history buff." 
Samahd said.  "Used to be the center of law and order in this place, trials and everything, but it turns out it's easier just to make the sim so crimes can't be committed."

He pointed to the flat wall of a convenience store.  "For instance, say you had a spraycan and you felt like tagging your name all over that thing."  He rummaged through his pockets for a moment.  "Damn, I don't have one.  I usually bring one for this demonstration.  Anyway, it wouldn't work.  You don't own that store, you don't have permission to modify it, you can't do anything to it."

After a few more moments he pulled an ordinary-looking keyring from his pocket.  "I'd say 'at least I remembered these' but as it happens they're always with you.  They look like keys - old metal style keys, you've probably noticed the taste for antiques around here - and they act like them, letting you into doors, opening whatever you've locked, that kind of thing.  You've likely got one for your apartment."

Dubiously, I reached into my pocket and pulled out a keyring.  It had one key, featuring the number "1336" emblazoned on it.  I let go and the ring and key vanished.  Patting the outside of my pocket revealed nothing, but reaching in again resulted in the same key.  I hadn't even felt it there.

"A lot of abstractions work like that - your entry permissions being actual keys, the time-is-money concept being made into real bills.  New Detroit's got an old-time asthetic because there's no point in having it look technological.  We're not only surrounded by technology, we //are// technology.  No need to lug around a holographic projector for your phone when old-fasioned business cards can do the same thing."

He shrugged.  "You really do get used to it.  Anyway, come on, let's go get religion."

The church was one of the few stand-out buildings I'd seen in this city.  Its peaked roof made it taller than most of its neighbors, and the stained glass mural comprising its sole window was possibly the most detailed thing I'd seen in the city, even if I couldn't tell what it was supposed to be depicting.

<<if $tourInProgress>>
"You a Preservationist?" Samahd, true to character, did not even remotely give me time to reply.  "If so, this is the place for you.  I mean, the whole sim is theirs so I think they figure if you're here you're as good as converted anyway.  But still, if you want to go all-in on the worship thing, these guys have you covered."

He took a few moments of precious precious silence to let me look over the building before continuing.  "Obviously, they're rich, but they don't pay much.  I mean, it's a church.  Most people volunteer."

"Anyway, religion is hard.  Let's go shopping."

:: shopping_exterior
New Detroit was a full-fledged city, and it was easy to forget that elsewhere.  Here, in the heart of the shopping district, it was obvious.  The hustle and bustle of human movement and conversation was more muted than it'd have been in the real world, but it still managed to be omnipresent.  And as in the real world, shopping seemed to be more popular than any other activity.

<<if $tourInProgress>>
"I wouldn't go on a spending spree right away!"  Samahd was having to speak up to be heard which, given the unrestrained volume he usually spoke at, was saying something.

He lead us toward a marginally more quiet corner of what was essentially a large strip mall.

"If you want to get a job, this is the easiest place to do it.  Some people order out of catalogs that act like the network-accessible shops you might be used to, but most people figure if they're going to get all old-timey, they're going to do it right.  In-person sales are pretty popular.  It only pays minimum wage - that's an hour per hour - but that'll extend you quite a bit."

He leaned back against the wall and people-watched for a while, which mostly forced me to do the same.  Shoppers here seemed focused and uninclined to talk, despite all the babble I heard in the air.

"Okay," Samahd was apparently done.  "enough regular people.  Let's go to the Arts District"

The Arts District was Broadway.  As it turned out, that wasn't a metaphor - someone had taken the entire cityscape of New York's theater district, scaled down the fidelity, mixed it up a bit, and placed it in New Detroit.

I wasn't sure which, if any, of the details they'd gotten correct, but the neon lights were in fact bright.

<<if $tourInProgress>>
"Shopping's a good pastime, but if you want more classy sort of entertainment - well, as classy as you're likely to find in this city - the arts district here is the best place to do it." Samahd was standing in front of the Park Theater, which I'd been pretty sure had burned down centuries ago.  People were apparently not the only things that got afterlives.

"Prices here are pretty reasonable.  Your real theater snobs are all up in New Amsterdam at a far better rendition of this building.  This is bottom floor for artists of all stripes, so you can even catch free shows."

Finally, after what felt like hours of false starts, I got a word in edgewise.  "I suppose you can get hired on as an usher?"

Samahd laughed.  "Yes, actually.  Most people here are actors, painters, musicians.  Being an usher would be better work if you could get it.  Everyone wants to start a band but, well, you know the phrase 'starving artist'?  It somehow manages to be true even in a place where you can't possibly starve."

"Once you're finished with what passes for 'upscale' around here, I'll take you to where the real fun happens."

"If you haven't guessed why this is separate from the arts district yet," Samahd said, gesturing to the greens, "it's because it's about three times bigger."

We passed a few voleyball courts and a soccer field.  "Every sport on the planet is represented here, and some new ones that you can't do in the real world.  I wouldn't recommend starting with those, by the way."  He pointed to a three-story tall translucent cube that apparently featured rapidly changing gravity as a core game mechanic.

"You mostly see sports-style games because those take the most room."  He pointed toward a small building off the main road.  "That leads to the arcades, underground.  Every video game we could licence - and with the kind of money the architects were throwing around, it was a lot - is available there, 15 minutes per play.  It ranges from some of the more recent full-immersion games - much easier to play here than in the real world, you don't need a sim implant or anything - to old-style mechanical pinball."

"Take it from me," he came to a halt at the intersection, "your video game skills, if any, will carry over into this world, but your athletic skills won't.  I was a researcher but played softball on the side.  Couldn't play it at all once I got uploaded.  Game's the same, but you kinda have to re-learn your proprioception."

He gestured to one of the windows.  "Those are the only windows in the city that are one-way.  Special dispensation from Athena, because what's going on in there is not pleasant.

"Sorry, don't mean to get all spookhouse on you, it's just the place has a bad reputation.  For the most part, it's full of people who've been in the simulation for a very long time, but for whatever reasons don't want to go into Storage.  Lots of people who were in the first wave of uploads, way back when.  It was more experimental in those days, and it didn't always work right.  Plus you've got the people who've got the double bad luck to have died bad and remember their deaths.  Physical trauma is a thing of the past if you stay on the right side of the tracks, but PTSD is forever."

He shook his head sadly.  "So yeah, the hospital look is not an accident."

Just as quickly, though, he seemed to come out of his reverie.  "Well, isn't that a high note to go out on.  Come on, tour's almost over, time to show you your new digs."

:: train_exterior
The train station consisted entirely of an awning over the waiting area by the tracks and a ticketing station manned by one supremely bored person.

A chalkboard featured the current transit prices:
* ''Metaverse:'' 8.45 centuries
* ''Satya Yuga:'' 3.10 centuries
* ''Valhalla:'' 1.20 centuries
* ''New Olympus:  You are here.''

"I mentioned earlier how the elevator doesn't take you off-grid." Samahd ignored the ticketing agent, and was ignored in return.  "Well this does.  If you wanted to visit any of the other sims we're networked to, this is the place."

He walked up to the chalkboard.  "Of course, moving all the data that makes up a human being isn't exactly cheap, as you can see, and those prices don't include however much it'll cost to simulate you once you're there.  If you want my advice, save up for a day trip to New Amsterdam, see the beaches.  As expensive as that is, it's way more worth it."

Conspicuously absent from your tour was the fact that a road goes over the tracks and leads on to another part of the city.

:: bed
The cot was, as I'd already guessed, exactly as featureless as the chairs in the waiting room had been.  I made a mental note to try lying on the floor some time to see if it felt any different whatsoever.

Still, I'd gotten sleep in worse places.

:: apartment_interior
Apartment 1336 was a 55-square-meter studio apartment.  It was sparsely decorated, as I'd assumed an apartment that nobody lived in until now would be, but it was at least furnished.

A leather-colored [[couch]] took the center stage, sitting across from an irritatingly small 50cm [[television]] that looked like something out of the black-and-white era.  If it didn't get color I was prepared to call bullshit on the entire idea of retrotechnology.

The kitchen nook featured a [[refrigerator]] and a few empty cupboards.  So far as I could tell, there was no laundry or bathroom - hopefully they weren't necessities in this world.

A [[bed]] that seemed barely a step up from a cot was shoved into the far corner.  <<if $sleepy>>Despite the fact that it is the very minimum required for an object to be called a 'bed', it was possibly the most inviting space I'd seen all day.  All I wanted to do was [[sleep]].<<endif>>

:: floor_13
My floor was, I highly suspected, exactly the same as all the others.  Room 36 was all the way to one end, and it was fortunate that they were all labeled.  The slightly garish false-gold numbers looked incredibly cheap; I could only hope that they were as indestructible as most everything else had thus far proven to be, or else I was very likely going to become lost in a maze of blank doors.

:: apartment_bldg_interior
The apartment interior featured more of the famed wood paneling.  Likely the exact same paneling, I reflected, if the copy-paste temperment was as pervasive inside as out.

A large glass double-door lead out to the streets, and a permanently propped open metal door pointed the way to the concrete stairway.  Whoever architected this must have figured an elevator was pointless when you can't possibly become exhausted.  I wanted to punch him.

:: television
Turning on the television was a lot faster once I realized there wasn't a remote control and I'd have to fiddle with the dials on the machine.

The television network in the afterlife was far worse than its real-world equivalent, mainly because for some reason there were no real-world shows.  Most channels appeared to be live feeds of various stages in the Arts District, and most of those were not active at the moment.
<<if not $heardOfDeath>>
<<set $heardOfDeath=1>>
One channel was news.  I was about to change the channel again when the headline at the bottom caught my eye:

''Iva Koloman Dead''

The announcer was doing his best to sound professional, but I could tell - he was at least a little bit rattled.

"To repeat, Athena has just confirmed with Motor News One that Iva Koloman is in fact dead.  Such a thing hasn't happened since the early days of our world, of course, and Athena stressed that - while she is still investigating - this is almost certainly an isolated incident.  Iva Koloman, 34, was found yesterday morning in her apartment by her fiancé.  The unresponsive state of her body and the system's inability to contact her lead many to speculate that she had died.  Moments ago, Athena confirmed this was the case."

Great, I'd died just in time for mortality to come to the afterlife.

The news was continuing its coverage of the Koloman case, and little else.  It made me wonder what they did on days nobody died.  I hoped I'd have the chance to find out.

:: couch
The couch didn't feel like leather.  It felt exactly the same as the chairs in the insurance building had - supportive, but otherwise barely present.  It wasn't exactly an //un//comfortable situation, but it was a far cry from comfort.

[[Stand back up|apartment_interior]]


:: refrigerator
My refrigerator was empty.  I supposed, given the fact that things in this world generally worked like the outside only with strange edge cases, that it was for storing food (as opposed to the cupboards?).

It made me wonder if I needed to eat.  I didn't feel hungry and I hadn't eaten all day.  Then again, I clearly needed sleep, so could the other necessities be that far behind?
