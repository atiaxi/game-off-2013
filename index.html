	<p>What happens after you die?  Simple - your implanted soulkeeper
	uploads you to a virtual world designed to simulate your brain so
	you can continue living.  (After)life in New Detroit is certainly no 
	paradise, but it beats the alternative, and you get to live forever.</p>

	<p>Except now, someone's died, and unless you can find out who and how,
	anyone could be next.</p>
