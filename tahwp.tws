"I suppose I have an appointment?"\u000a\u000aThe receptionist looked up at me as though I was barely more interesting than the game of solitaire she'd been cheating at.  "Not as such, no."  She went back to the game.\u000a\u000aI waited for her to continue talking, and she waited for me to sit back down.  She had the advantage of long hours' practice at ignoring waiting rooms, but I was dead.  It wasn't as though I had anywhere else to be.\u000a\u000aShe looked back up.  "Mr. Guillory will see you as soon as he is available.  Please wait your turn."\u000a\u000aI glanced back at the row of four seats that apparently sufficed as a waiting room.  Without me there to provide bulk, they were empty.  I opened my mouth to-\u000a\u000a"He's with a client."  the receptionist said before I could even turn my head back.\u000a\u000aI nodded.

VI was expecting the seats to either be uncomfortably thin or absurdly over-stuffed, in the style of waiting room seats everywhere.  These looked thin but didn't feel it.  They didn't feel like much of anything, to be honest.  I could have been sitting on a box and leaning against the wall and gotten more of a sensory experience out of it.\u000a\u000aThat I was reduced to mentally critiquing the furniture indicated a lot about my [[mental state|intro_mentalstate]].\u000a\u000a* [[Wait|intro_invite_in]]

VI shrugged.  I'd gathered I was dead, that the afterlife was poorly decorated, and that angels (or devils, the state of my soul was still up in the air) had names like "Alex Guillory".  Everything else was news to me.\u000a\u000aAlex made a note in my file and nodded.  "Memory can take a while to be re-accessible."  He closed the folder and looked up at me.  "Well, I have answers."\u000a\u000aHe gestured around himself, indicating that I should take in the room.  There wasn't much to see - the same faux-wood paneling on the walls, an uninspired plastic desk, the job plaque I'd noted earlier, a cup of pens.\u000a\u000aI'd been a private investigator in my previous life, though, so I also noticed what wasn't in the room.\u000a\u000aGuillory's desk only had his plaque, the pens, and the manilla folder.  There were no ports to plug anything into, and no ports for output.  The holographic projection interface you'd need if you wanted to use the desk for anything other than putting things on was conspicuously absent.  The desk was either a great deal less advanced than the desks I was familiar with, or a great deal more.\u000a\u000aNow that I was thinking about plugs, ports, and electronics I noticed more:  There were no electronics at all, and the corresponding places where they'd interface were also missing.  No charging stations.  There wasn't even a light switch and, now that I was looking, no /light/.\u000a\u000aI frowned at the last observation.  The room was lit perfectly - there weren't even shadows.  I'd say it was impossible but I'd already done one impossible thing today just by being here.\u000a\u000a* [[Mention the strangeness of this place|intro_bridge]]

V"This place is no insurance agency, that's for sure."  I said, gesturing to his plaque.\u000a\u000aGuillory chuckled.  "Actually, we are."  Opening the folder again, he pulled out a rather large bundle of paper, stapled together.  I hadn't remembered the folder holding that much, but I didn't get the chance to ask before Guillory turned the paper to face me and put it down on the desk.  "This is your policy."\u000a\u000aI wanted to ask Guillory for clarification, but I had the feeling the policy would speak for itself.  Unsurprisingly, it was by the same naggingly familiar "Life Preservers Insurance" and seemed to be pretty standard legalese.

V"The Soulkeeper is you - at least, the you that you are now."\u000a\u000aGuillory saw my nonplussed expression.\u000a\u000a"Well, it's a bit more technical than what I'm about to describe, but simply put, the soulkeeper contains a few hundred billion tiny machines.  These machines are very small - the term 'microscopic' is too large, to give you an idea - such that all these machines can quite easily fit within your head."\u000a\u000aI didn't like where this was going.  Obviously I couldn't argue the end result, but the process was already sounding very uncomfortable.\u000a\u000aThe insurance agent seemed to notice my discomfort.  "It's actually quite noninvasive.  The machines are smaller than even your own brain cells.  That's their job, after all - once implanted, each device finds a nerve to latch on to.  From there, it goes about recording everything.  What causes this nerve to fire?  What levels of neurotransmitters are present at the time it does so?  When does this nerve die, and if this happens what is the cause?  Is there a replacement?"\u000a\u000a"So they learned how to be me."  I observed.\u000a\u000aGuillory nodded.  "Exactly!"\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_guillory]]

VThe question made Guillory smile.  "That's somewhat of our mission statement."\u000a\u000a"Life Preservers Insurance," he said with the same air of rehearsed speech he'd had earlier, "was founded to provide people with policies that could be used to keep them alive in this simulation after they'd passed on.\u000a\u000a"That is somewhat of an important point - we are not a traditional insurance company.  We do not insure houses, or health, or even life in the usual manner - though much of the funding that finances your part of the simulation is derived from a life insurance policy.  Instead, we're an insurance company dedicated to getting people to the /next/ life.  This life.\u000a\u000a"In this way, we further <<set $heardOfPreservationists=1>>Preserver goals and, best of all, keep people alive and well."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_guillory]]

V"The process is very technical" Guillory literally handwaved the response.  At least he had the decency to almost immediately realize that I wasn't going to find that a satisfactory answer.\u000a\u000a"Well," he began again, "your soulkeeper <<set $heardOfSoulkeeper=1>>is extracted after your death.  Its patterns are fed into the large banks of machinery that make up this world, and those computers then add your mind to its simulation."\u000a\u000a"Simulation."  I said.  Suddenly the copy-and-paste furniture made a great deal more sense.\u000a\u000a"Yes.  I don't know your religious leanings, <<print $gender>> Hallivert, but this is not a spiritual afterlife.  You are currently within the memory and processors of nearly five thousand top-of the line servers at a data-center in Boulder City, Nevada."\u000a\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_guillory]]

V"Not exactly."  Now that a less professional topic such as religion had come up, Guillory looked a lot less comfortable.  "This company was founded by the Preservationist movement, of course, and a fair amount of stock is still owned by the church.  But-" he held up a finger to stress the point "we don't require that our clients adopt, share, or even entertain such beliefs.\u000a\u000a"Obviously, believing that people should be preserved after they die and working at an agency like this are quite compatible.  Similarly, those that believe in a non-digitizable soul that they will take with them to a true afterlife are unlikely to sign up for our services.  Still, we are open to all."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_guillory]]\u000a

VGuillory smiled widely.  "That's entirely up to you.  You have most of another whole life ahead of you.  Many of our clients dedicate themselves to art, or mastering a skill that they lacked in life.  Many others simply lie back and relax, treating this as an extended retirement."\u000a\u000aHe gestured down to the sheaf of paper on his desk that was my insurance policy.  "The policy you purchased in life gives you fifty years of New Detroit time - more specifically, a little over three million seconds subjectively.  Time flows a little bit differently from city to city, but nothing you'll notice unless you spend a while there, and should you be able to afford that you'll likely have more time than you need anyway."\u000a\u000a"Afford?"  I looked at him skeptically.  There was always a catch.\u000a\u000a"You've no doubt heard the phrase 'time is money'?  Well here it is literally true.<<set $heardTimeIsMoney=1>>  What your policy paid for is enough computing power to simulate you for fifty years at the level of fidelity that New Detroit offers.  That money on the outside became time here.  Time here is a valuable and scarce commodity that cannot be counterfeited.  Your fifty years is currency - a fair bit of it, actually.  I would advise you not to spend it all in one place."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_guillory]]

VA vague grimace game over Guillory's face.  "It's not a scenario we like to discuss - nothing terrible!" He rushed to reassure me despite the fact that I hadn't appeared surprised or worried at all.  "Anyone who runs out of time is simply downgraded to Storage.  We're Preservers, after all<<set $heardOfPreservationists=1>>, we're not going to just delete someone."\u000a\u000aDespite the calming tone, I didn't like the sound of Storage.\u000a\u000aGuillory had anticipated my next question.  "Yes, Storage is what it sounds like.  Your patterns that are currently in simulation now are stored on disk - and also redundantly backed up, of course.  You will no longer be simulated, but of course it's the Preservationist belief that eventually simulation costs will be so low that everyone can be revived for free.  At that point, you'll be returned, likely to this very office."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_guillory]]\u000a

VI stood in front of the Life Preservers Insurance building - a middling grey cube in the sea of middling grey cubes that apparently made up this place.  It was dark - and I very quickly got the impression that it was always dark - but surprisingly quiet for a modern city.  No horns blared, nobody yelled from the window of their car.  There didn't appear to be any traffic whatsoever, that I noticed.  A few people trudged by now and then, silent in their contemplation or more likely spending all their mental energy on gathering the willpower necessary to take another step.\u000a\u000a<<if not $wasOfferedTour>>\u000a<<display "ferro_offer_tour">>\u000a<<else>>\u000a<<if $acceptingTour>>\u000aSamahd was standing in front of the building, as promised.

VGuillory consults his notes.  "Looks like you were struck by a car?"  his voice radiates confusion.  \u000a\u000a"I got run over?"  I asked.  It was absurd - cars had dozens of redundant systems designed to prevent the computers that drove them from hitting people.  You could walk across a busy freeway in complete safety, provided you didn't mind heading to court afterward and paying a hefty fine for disrupting traffic.\u000a\u000aGuillory nods.  "Ah, here it is, you were struck by a //non-automatic// car.  Not a lot of people who don't have a self-driving car nowadays, but the hold-outs tend to be rather deluded about how good they are at driving."\u000a\u000aI'd been under the impression that dumb-cars had been finally outlawed years ago.  I hadn't really cared about the issue at the time, and now it was quite obviously too late.\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_guillory]]\u000a

V<<set $money = $money - 7>><<set $tourInProgress = 1>><<set $ferroInPerson=1>>I looked through my wallet and discovered I had exact change.  Hoping this worked like it did in the real world, I took seven days worth of bills out and handed it over to Samahd.  He smiled and took it, so I must have done something right.\u000a\u000a"All right, let's get started!  Let's see, basic information you need to know:  This is New Detroit, the lowest level of the simulation.  You've probably noticed all the lack of amenities - no shadows, no smells, no heat or cold, sounds don't travel far, lots of things lack texture - you get used to it.  You probably wouldn't even have noticed if I hadn't pointed them out." He grinned prankishly and started numbering things on his hand.\u000a\u000a"First, you can't die here."  There was something in the tone of his voice when he said this, but as usual I couldn't get him to stop long enough to ask.  "Where would you go, right?  Second, you can't be hurt here unless you go into the wrong neighborhood - and you'll know it if that happens.  Third, you can't be robbed - other people can't even //see// your wallet, let alone take anything out of it.  This Detroit's a lot safer than the real one, if a lot less scenic."\u000a\u000a"Fourth:  Don't run out of time.  That's a one-way ticket to Storage.  I'd recommend getting a job - even one that pays one day per day is a pretty good gig, keeps you going."\u000a\u000aSamahd looked down at his hands as though he'd forgotten something, then shook his head to dismiss it.  "Anyway, enough about the new motor city in general, let's get specific."\u000a\u000aHe smiled his tour-guide smile and gestured to the Insurance building behind us.  "This, as you're probably already aware, is the Life Preservers Insurance building.  Drop-off point for new uploads fresh off the bus.  They've got customer service agents always ready to talk, they sometimes help with job placement if you're willing to pay for it.  Kinda self-defeating if you ask me, but hey, whatever works."\u000a\u000a"Up this way is the Power of Two."

V"The Power of Two" sounded like it ought to be a bordello, and as I got closer to the building I could tell that this impression was, if anything, understated.\u000a\u000aPosters of naked women covered every available surface of the building, in many cases obscuring each other and in some places overlapping with the neon sign naming the building.  A very few ordinary signs were visible:  One proclaiming "Titanic Tits!" and another in much smaller type explaining that the cover charge to enter was 1 day.\u000a<<if $tourInProgress>>\u000aSamahd gestured to the display and wiggled his eyebrows suggestively.  "I'm not here to judge!".\u000a\u000aGrinning, he donned his tour-guide voice.  "This, as you've probably guessed, is New Detroit's premiere whorehouse.  Athena - that's the AI that runs this sim - doesn't let people just turn their brain's pleasure center on and ignore the world, so sex is still very much a thing!  It's got some benefits over the real thing.  No diseases, nobody can possibly get pregnant, nobody's forced into it because you can't be forced into anything here - it's pretty much the best brothel ever, anywhere."\u000a\u000aHe shrugs.

VBar Ocho looks like someone took the platonic ideal of 'Bar' and copy-pasted it into the city.  Considering the fact that this was a simulated city, that might not have been too far from the truth.  The name of the bar was in neon, as far too many building signs seemed to be.  The "O" in "Ocho" was overlaying a large stylized 8-ball.  I found myself wondering if anyone played pool in New Detroit.\u000a\u000a<<if $tourInProgress>>\u000aSamahd stood to the side of the bar's door.  "For future reference, this is where I am on almost all of my downtime.  I mean, I'll give you my card at the end of the tour, but not everything is business, right?  Sometimes you need to unwind.  That's what this place is for!  The beer's not as effective as on the outside, but the upside is that you can't become addicted to it.  Simulation doesn't allow it.  Great, huh?"\u000a\u000aHe gestured up to the non-buzzing neon sign.  "Oh, another thing.  See that sign?  That's a pun in my language.  'Borracho' means 'drunk'.  Despite the America-centric theme of the city names, there are more languages spoken here than in any other one place on earth.  Turns out translation is only hard for computers when they don't have full access to the mind-state of the people doing the talking.  So if you never got to learn another language in your previous life, don't worry!  You'll never need to!"\u000a\u000aHe stepped away from the door and started walking up the street, pointing to a large vertical column in the distance.  The slightly glowing blue cylinder was far taller than any other building - or anything I'd ever seen in either life.  "That thing is our next stop."\u000a\u000a* [[Follow him|elevator_exterior]]\u000a<<else>>\u000a* [[Head to the Elevator|elevator_exterior]]\u000a* [[Go to the Hub|Hub]]\u000a* [[Peek in at the Power of Two|power_of_two_exterior]]\u000a<<endif>>\u000a

VEvery other building in New Detroit seemed to have been cut from the same block of concrete.  The Elevator was different.  A sleek blue steel column, it started from ground level and stretched upward into the sky.  I couldn't tell where - if anywhere - it stopped.\u000a<<if $cardKoloman>>\u000a* [[Enter the elevator|elevator_interior]]\u000a<<endif>><<if $tourInProgress>>\u000a"Yeah."  Samahd nodded.  "That's the Elevator, it's how you get to other cities in the same simulation.  It could have been an airport or something, but I think the people who designed it liked the Elevator metaphor.  They're above us that way."\u000a\u000aHe turned back to me.  "Like I said at the beginning, this sim's workable but missing some amenities.  Nothing here takes your breath away, right?"\u000a\u000aI knew he used that phrase on purpose, because I noticed then that I wasn't breathing.  I hadn't been breathing the entire time.  I didn't think I //could// breathe and, most strange of all, this fact did not trigger a panicked choking for survival.\u000a\u000a"Yeah, this stage of the sim, the city we call New Detroit, it's just above the brain-in-a-jar level.  You get most of your brain simulated but almost none of your internal organs.  Cuts down on the overhead of the sim, you can fit more people in cheaply.\u000a\u000a"Ever have a dream that, when you wake up, you realize was utterly absurd?" Again, without waiting for an answer, he continued, "Why didn't you realize it in the dream?  I mean, four-armed gorilla monsters from space aren't even remotely real, but your dream-self doesn't question it.  It's the same thing here.  There's a part of your brain dedicated to constantly asking the question 'does this make any damn sense at all?'.  In dreams, it's shut off.  Here?  It's not even simulated."\u000a\u000aHe gestured back to the column.  "That's not the case everywhere.  The next city up is New Phoenix.  They've got shadows, better physics, more texture, better sound, but still no internals.  It's the same sim, keep in mind that this isn't taking you off-grid or anything, it's just that they dedicate a lot more computing power to NPX.  It costs a lot more too, though - the ratio of New Detroit time to New Phoenix time is about 50:1.  One day's vacation would cost you a couple months.  That scale's just about the same all the way up, too.  Next city's New Amsterdam, and that's fifty times more expensive than New Phoenix.  Top of the pack is New Providence.  It's fifty times more expensive than NA.  I don't know if you've done the math, but that means you could spend a lifetime in a few minutes."\u000a\u000aHe shook his head.  "Too rich for our blood, in other words.  Come on, let me show you the courthouse."\u000a\u000a* [[Follow him|courthouse_exterior]]\u000a<<else>>\u000a* [[Walk to the Courthouse|courthouse_exterior]]\u000a* [[Go to the Hub|Hub]]\u000a* [[Visit Bar Ocho|bar_ocho_exterior]]\u000a<<endif>>\u000a

VThe architects who created New Detroit clearly had an extremely generic template - the Courthouse could not have looked any more the part.  Faux-marble stairs, textured columns, even a statue of justice out front.\u000a\u000a<<if $tourInProgress>>\u000a"You probably will never see the inside of this place unless you decide to become a history buff." \u000aSamahd said.  "Used to be the center of law and order in this place, trials and everything, but it turns out it's easier just to make the sim so crimes can't be committed."\u000a\u000aHe pointed to the flat wall of a convenience store.  "For instance, say you had a spraycan and you felt like tagging your name all over that thing."  He rummaged through his pockets for a moment.  "Damn, I don't have one.  I usually bring one for this demonstration.  Anyway, it wouldn't work.  You don't own that store, you don't have permission to modify it, you can't do anything to it."\u000a\u000aAfter a few more moments he pulled an ordinary-looking keyring from his pocket.  "I'd say 'at least I remembered these' but as it happens they're always with you.  They look like keys - old metal style keys, you've probably noticed the taste for antiques around here - and they act like them, letting you into doors, opening whatever you've locked, that kind of thing.  You've likely got one for your apartment."\u000a\u000aDubiously, I reached into my pocket and pulled out a keyring.  It had one key, featuring the number "1336" emblazoned on it.  I let go and the ring and key vanished.  Patting the outside of my pocket revealed nothing, but reaching in again resulted in the same key.  I hadn't even felt it there.\u000a\u000a"A lot of abstractions work like that - your entry permissions being actual keys, the time-is-money concept being made into real bills.  New Detroit's got an old-time asthetic because there's no point in having it look technological.  We're not only surrounded by technology, we //are// technology.  No need to lug around a holographic projector for your phone when old-fasioned business cards can do the same thing."\u000a\u000aHe shrugged.  "You really do get used to it.  Anyway, come on, let's go get religion."\u000a\u000a* [[Follow him|church_exterior]]\u000a<<else>>\u000a* [[Enter the Courthouse|courthouse_interior]]\u000a* [[Visit the Church|church_exterior]]\u000a* [[Go to the Hub|Hub]]\u000a* [[See the elevator|elevator_exterior]]\u000a<<endif>>

VThe church was one of the few stand-out buildings I'd seen in this city.  Its peaked roof made it taller than most of its neighbors, and the stained glass mural comprising its sole window was possibly the most detailed thing I'd seen in the city, even if I couldn't tell what it was supposed to be depicting.\u000a\u000a<<if $tourInProgress>>\u000a"You a Preservationist?" Samahd, true to character, did not even remotely give me time to reply.  "If so, this is the place for you.  I mean, the whole sim is theirs so I think they figure if you're here you're as good as converted anyway.  But still, if you want to go all-in on the worship thing, these guys have you covered."\u000a\u000aHe took a few moments of precious precious silence to let me look over the building before continuing.  "Obviously, they're rich, but they don't pay much.  I mean, it's a church.  Most people volunteer."\u000a\u000a"Anyway, religion is hard.

VNew Detroit was a full-fledged city, and it was easy to forget that elsewhere.  Here, in the heart of the shopping district, it was obvious.  The hustle and bustle of human movement and conversation was more muted than it'd have been in the real world, but it still managed to be omnipresent.  And as in the real world, shopping seemed to be more popular than any other activity.\u000a\u000a<<if $tourInProgress>>\u000a"I wouldn't go on a spending spree right away!"  Samahd was having to speak up to be heard which, given the unrestrained volume he usually spoke at, was saying something.\u000a\u000aHe lead us toward a marginally more quiet corner of what was essentially a large strip mall.\u000a\u000a"If you want to get a job, this is the easiest place to do it.  Some people order out of catalogs that act like the network-accessible shops you might be used to, but most people figure if they're going to get all old-timey, they're going to do it right.  In-person sales are pretty popular.  It only pays minimum wage - that's an hour per hour - but that'll extend you quite a bit."\u000a\u000aHe leaned back against the wall and people-watched for a while, which mostly forced me to do the same.  Shoppers here seemed focused and uninclined to talk, despite all the babble I heard in the air.\u000a\u000a"Okay," Samahd was apparently done.  "enough regular people.  Let's go to the Arts District"\u000a\u000a* [[Follow him|arts_exterior]]\u000a<<else>>\u000a* [[Make your way to the Arts District|arts_exterior]]\u000a* [[Go to the Hub|Hub]]\u000a* [[Go to Church|church_exterior]]\u000a<<endif>>\u000a

VThe Arts District was Broadway.  As it turned out, that wasn't a metaphor - someone had taken the entire cityscape of New York's theater district, scaled down the fidelity, mixed it up a bit, and placed it in New Detroit.\u000a\u000aI wasn't sure which, if any, of the details they'd gotten correct, but the neon lights were in fact bright.\u000a\u000a<<if $tourInProgress>>\u000a"Shopping's a good pastime, but if you want more classy sort of entertainment - well, as classy as you're likely to find in this city - the arts district here is the best place to do it." Samahd was standing in front of the Park Theater, which I'd been pretty sure had burned down centuries ago.  People were apparently not the only things that got afterlives.\u000a\u000a"Prices here are pretty reasonable.  Your real theater snobs are all up in New Amsterdam at a far better rendition of this building.  This is bottom floor for artists of all stripes, so you can even catch free shows."\u000a\u000aFinally, after what felt like hours of false starts, I got a word in edgewise.  "I suppose you can get hired on as an usher?"\u000a\u000aSamahd laughed.  "Yes, actually.  Most people here are actors, painters, musicians.  Being an usher would be better work if you could get it.  Everyone wants to start a band but, well, you know the phrase 'starving artist'?  It somehow manages to be true even in a place where you can't possibly starve."\u000a\u000a"Once you're finished with what passes for 'upscale' around here, I'll take you to where the real fun happens."\u000a\u000a* [[Follow him|games_exterior]]\u000a<<else>>\u000a<<if $investigating>>\u000aIva had lived here in the arts district - if I was going to find out what happened to her, chances were good I'd be looking around here.\u000a\u000a[[Iva's house|ivahouse_exterior]] was the obvious first choice of destination.\u000a\u000a<<if $hasTroupeAddress>>\u000aIva had made friends of her [[acting troupe|theater]]; they might have a few answers.\u000a/%%/<<endif>><<if $hasBoyfriendAddress>>\u000aIva's [[boyfriend|bfhouse_exterior]] was an obvious person of interest.\u000a/%%/<<endif>>\u000a\u000a<<endif>>\u000a* [[Head toward the Games District|games_exterior]]\u000a* [[Go to the Hub|Hub]]\u000a* [[Go shopping|shopping_exterior]]\u000a<<endif>>

VThe Games District was obvious - it was surrounded by golf courses.  The sudden lack of buildings hanging over me gave me the strange fleeting feeling of agoraphobia.\u000a\u000a<<if $tourInProgress>>\u000a"If you haven't guessed why this is separate from the arts district yet," Samahd said, gesturing to the greens, "it's because it's about three times bigger."\u000a\u000aWe passed a few voleyball courts and a soccer field.  "Every sport on the planet is represented here, and some new ones that you can't do in the real world.  I wouldn't recommend starting with those, by the way."  He pointed to a three-story tall translucent cube that apparently featured rapidly changing gravity as a core game mechanic.\u000a\u000a"You mostly see sports-style games because those take the most room."  He pointed toward a small building off the main road.  "That leads to the arcades, underground.  Every video game we could licence - and with the kind of money the architects were throwing around, it was a lot - is available there, 15 minutes per play.  It ranges from some of the more recent full-immersion games - much easier to play here than in the real world, you don't need a sim implant or anything - to old-style mechanical pinball."\u000a\u000a"Take it from me," he came to a halt at the intersection, "your video game skills, if any, will carry over into this world, but your athletic skills won't.  I was a researcher but played softball on the side.  Couldn't play it at all once I got uploaded.  Game's the same, but you kinda have to re-learn your proprioception."\u000a\u000aThat explained why my reflexes were terrible, at least.\u000a\u000a"Come on, we've got a train to catch."\u000a\u000a* [[Follow him|train_exterior]]\u000a<<else>>\u000a* [[Enter the Arcade|games_interior]]\u000a* [[Head toward the train station|train_exterior]]\u000a* [[Go to the Hub|Hub]]\u000a* [[Visit the Arts District|arts_exterior]]\u000a<<endif>>\u000a

"Of course, moving all the data that makes up a human being isn't exactly cheap, as you can see, and those prices don't include however much it'll cost to simulate you once you're there.

VA sign outlined in brick proclaimed the building behind the thick iron fence to be the "Shady Acres Retirement Home".  The building itself wasn't exactly welcoming, either.  It looked like a cross between a cheap hotel and a hospital.\u000a\u000a<<if $tourInProgress>>\u000a"You can't get in here without an invite" Samahd leaned up against the also-thick-iron gate.  "And trust me, that's for your own good, not theirs."\u000a\u000aHe gestured to one of the windows.  "Those are the only windows in the city that are one-way.  Special dispensation from Athena, because what's going on in there is not pleasant.\u000a\u000a"Sorry, don't mean to get all spookhouse on you, it's just the place has a bad reputation.  For the most part, it's full of people who've been in the simulation for a very long time, but for whatever reasons don't want to go into Storage.  Lots of people who were in the first wave of uploads, way back when.  It was more experimental in those days, and it didn't always work right.  Plus you've got the people who've got the double bad luck to have died bad and remember their deaths.  Physical trauma is a thing of the past if you stay on the right side of the tracks, but PTSD is forever."\u000a\u000aHe shook his head sadly.  "So yeah, the hospital look is not an accident."\u000a\u000aJust as quickly, though, he seemed to come out of his reverie.  "Well, isn't that a high note to go out on.  Come on, tour's almost over, time to show you your new digs."\u000a\u000a* [[Follow him|apartment_exterior]]\u000a<<else>>\u000aNext to the iron gate was a small call-box featuring little more than a button and a sign that read "Official business only"\u000a\u000a* [[Press the button|asylum_greet]]\u000a\u000a* [[Go home|apartment_exterior]]\u000a* [[Go to the Hub|Hub]]\u000a* [[Visit the Train Station|train_exterior]]\u000a<<endif>>\u000a

V741 McGraw St, Apartment #1336 - I knew it was my home without having to consult any notes, or even having to be told.

"For reference, this way leads back to the insurance offices, and over there leads to the neighborhood people around here call "The Hub".  It's an easy way to get across the city without having to walk through half the districts, but it's not on the tour because it's boring.  Keep in mind that this is a tour that features an insurance company, so when I say 'boring', I mean //boring//.\u000a\u000a"And finally," with a deft twist of his hand, he produced a business card like the one Guillory had given me.

VMy floor was, I highly suspected, exactly the same as all the others.  Room 36 was all the way to one end, and it was fortunate that they were all labeled.  The slightly garish false-gold numbers looked incredibly cheap; I could only hope that they were as indestructible as most everything else had thus far proven to be, or else I was very likely going to become lost in a maze of blank doors.\u000a\u000a* [[Enter your apartment|apartment_interior]]\u000a* [[Go back down the stairs|apartment_bldg_interior]]\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

VApartment 1336 was a 55-square-meter studio apartment.  It was sparsely decorated, as I'd assumed an apartment that nobody lived in until now would be, but it was at least furnished.\u000a\u000aA leather-colored [[couch]] took the center stage, sitting across from an irritatingly small 50cm [[television]] that looked like something out of the black-and-white era.  If it didn't get color I was prepared to call bullshit on the entire idea of retrotechnology.\u000a\u000aThe kitchen nook featured a [[refrigerator]] and a few empty cupboards.  So far as I could tell, there was no laundry or bathroom - hopefully they weren't necessities in this world.\u000a\u000a<<if $storagePlan eq 1>>I needed to [[write a note]] for Koloman to 'find' after I'd been stored.\u000a/%%/<<endif>>A [[bed]] that seemed barely a step up from a cot was shoved into the far corner.  <<if $sleepy>>Despite the fact that it is the very minimum required for an object to be called a 'bed', it was possibly the most inviting space I'd seen all day.

Such a thing hasn't happened since the early days of our world, of course, and Athena stressed that - while she is still investigating - this is almost certainly an isolated incident.  Iva Koloman, 34, was found yesterday morning in her apartment by her fianc.  The unresponsive state of her body and the system's inability to contact her lead many to speculate that she had died.

Naturally, Koloman started talking right as I was about to speak up to ask if he was still there.\u000a\u000a"Yes." he said, the stress and heartbreak obvious in his voice to even an untrained listener.  "She was my daughter."\u000a\u000aThere was another silence.\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|recruitment_hub]]\u000a

Instead, each had been replaced with a guard.\u000a\u000a<<if not $nftElevator>><<set $nftElevator=1>>I found out why when I tried to get into the elevator - one of the more intimidating-looking of them stepped in front of me.\u000a\u000a"<<if $gender eq "Mr.">>Sir,<<else>>Miss,<<endif>> I'm going to have to ask you to step back.

"I've got an urgent appointment with Nikolai Koloman."\u000a\u000aWhatever his faults - and waking me up in the morning still ranked pretty heinously - Koloman had not been a liar.  The guard visibly stiffened and almost seemed like he was about to salute me.

VI considered myself a good judge of character.  The ability to tell who's lying and who thinks they're telling the truth was a cornerstone of my business.  So it confused the hell out of me when Koloman appeared genuinely confused.\u000a\u000a"I would not have done such a thing."  he said finally.  "I cannot speak with authority on what happened to you during our call, and I do not wish to call your judgement into question - that would bode ill for the both of us - but many who are recent uploads into our world suffer adjustment symptoms.  It may have been that."\u000a\u000aWhen that answer didn't appear to satisfy me (because it didn't), he continued solemnly.  "I swear to you, <<print $gender>> Hallivert, I did not lock you in your room.  I want to hire a detective who is willing to take the case - more, who demands that justice be done.  If you are not that person, I'll not make you agree."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_koloman]]\u000a

VNickolai nodded at the question.  "A reasonable thing to ask.  There must be, you are thinking, many other detectives with more experience, and more knowledge of how the system functions."\u000a\u000aI'd more been wondering which of my specific virtues he'd thought of when he called me.\u000a\u000aKoloman continued talking.  "This is true.  You are inexperienced in this world and, compared to some of those here who have been investigators for over a century total, inexperienced at the job.  It is precisely for these reasons that I wish to hire you."\u000a\u000aThis was not a very good pep speech.\u000a\u000a"I am not sure if you have noticed, but police presense in New Detroit is... nil, to put it nicely.  There are men and women who used to be police in their former lives, but most of them have retired.  There is no need to police when the simulation can do so automatically, with far greater coverage and effectiveness.  Hmph.\u000a\u000a"What I am saying is that any overly-visible response such as hiring an expensive investigator would bring these men out of their retirement.  They have even less experience than you, but wield considerable clout.  They would make a show out of the investigation - moreso than it already is - and, I suspect, be ineffective at the actual investigating. \u000a\u000a"You, on the other hand, can ask questions in nearly complete freedom.  You are new to the system, it is expected that you will not understand it and will need to ask questions.  You have been assured of your immortality and yet seen someone stripped of that very guarantee.  Every act of investigation will be expected of you naturally."\u000a\u000aI frowned.  "So does this mean I won't officially be on the case?"  I'd already seen what dropping Koloman's name could do in terms of getting people to co-operate; it was a powerful weapon I'd rather not be without.\u000a\u000a"You will very much be on this case, <<print $gender>> Hallivert."  Koloman answered stonily.  "It will appear to the officials and gossips of this town that I am not taking my daughter's death seriously with your hire, and I am prepared to endure such accusations because I believe you will find me answers."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_koloman]]\u000a

V"I was a neurobiologist."\u000a\u000aI'd been lied to plenty in my life, but this one very nearly took the cake.  "Bullshit."  I replied.\u000a\u000aSamahd hoisted his glass.  "I swear upon this beer, I was a neurobiologist in life."  I was't sure whether his drinking the object of his vow invalidated it, but it didn't seem to stop him.\u000a\u000a"But you're a tour guide."  I stated.  I began considering the idea that Samahd was actually independently wealthy and just showing newbies around as a form of slumming.\u000a\u000a"I don't know if you follow the trade," Samahd replied in a tone that indicated he knew exactly how much I followed his trade, "but neurobiology is on the outs."\u000a\u000aHe started counting off reasons on his fingers.  "One:  The biology part.  The only part of biology you need is the part that makes the sensors for the brain-upload machines.\u000a\u000a"Two:  The 'neuro' part.  All of that is done by computers pretty much exactly like the one you're currently in.  If you want to do research, you just get consent from someone who's already been uploaded and watch their brain do their thing.  You barely have to know anything about neurons or how they're connected because the machines take care of that.\u000a\u000a"Three:  You can't do it from inside the machine.  At least not here in New Olympus; got outlawed sometime back, probably because someone wrecked someone else's brain or something.\u000a\u000a"Four:  There's no money in it.  Once the technology got good enough to do a full simulation, why bother doing anything else?  You've got your AI researchers making better machine intelligences, but that kinda rules out biology by definition."\u000a\u000aSamahd's omnipresent smile had actually dampened somewhat at this point, and he seemed to take a moment to put it back into place.  "Sorry if I sound cynical.  The ghosts of factory workers everywhere are laughing at me for being replaced by a machine, especially now that I am one.  I can't be too angry - the field used to be decently paying if not lucrative, and I could afford a few decades of afterlife, so it's not too bad."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_ferro]]\u000a

He lives up in New Providence on a //lifetime pass//.  And that's his new, non-mortal lifetime."\u000a\u000a"I should take the job, then?"  I didn't think I really needed to ask the question, but Samahd surprised me.\u000a\u000a"No.  Well, you should definitely go up there and listen.  If he's sponsoring you a free trip to New Providence?  Go just to experience it.  New Detroit will never seem the same.  But accept the job?  I wouldn't be so fast.  If someone rich as the king of bankers wants something from you and is willing to pay accordingly, it's going to be damn near impossible to actually do.  And you do not want to piss a man like Koloman off."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_ferro]]\u000a\u000a

VSamahd looks dumbfounded.  "What, you'd been locked //in//?  So far as I know, that's impossible.  Well, it's impossible to get stuck either way when it comes to your own property.  Only person who could do that is Athena herself, and I doubt her holiness bothers slumming it on this level just to pull a few pranks."\u000a\u000a"It happened."  I replied tersely.  I was getting a little tired of people not believing something I'd rather vividly lived through.\u000a\u000aSamahd just shrugged.  "I've got an answer you're not going to like:  noob fever."\u000a\u000a"What," I enunciated, "the hell," I added for emphasis, "is noob fever?"\u000a\u000aMy tour guide looked like he was debating between cracking up at this question and sparing me some dignity.  Fortunately for both of us, he chose the second option.\u000a\u000a"Kinda a slang term, in case you hadn't figured it out.  And like I said, you're not going to like it.  But not everyone who uploads uploads... whole.  Used to happen a lot more often, when the system was new and parts were still experimental.  Still happens from time to time, though.  There are patterns in the brain that take a while to adapt to a simulated experience.  Like you've probably slept since you got here, right?  You don't need sleep, but it's so hardwired into your brain that it'll take you a few months to realize it."\u000a\u000a"So sleeping makes you crazy?"  It was the most reasonable of the various ridiculous ideas floating through my head.\u000a\u000a"Not what I'm saying, it was just an example of something that holds over from life.  Some folks, they still get hungry or thirsty for awhile.  But in some cases, it's worse.  Schizophrenia sets in for some folks.  Psychosis, agoraphobia, mania - depression too, but that's pretty treatable."\u000a\u000a"So I'm crazy."  I was pretty sure I wasn't crazy, but wasn't that what all crazy people thought?\u000a\u000a"Also not what I'm saying.  I'm saying it's a spectrum, okay?  It's called noob //fever// because, like a fever, it goes away.  People've come in to the sim ranting that the lizard people are the true masters of the world, and a few weeks down the line they'll be laughing about how utterly crazy that all seems now."\u000a\u000aEven though I was utterly certain that I'd endured that strange episode in my apartment, it was still relieving to hear that, even if it was in my head, it was probably temporary.\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_ferro]]\u000a

VGuillory's sole reaction was a slight raising of one of his eyebrows.  "That is a very influential person who contacted you."\u000a\u000a"So can I trust him?"  It was the most important question.  Of course, if Koloman was as important as Guillory had just said, it was possible I couldn't trust anyone's answer to that question.\u000a\u000a"He strikes me as a mostly reputable businessman" was the eventual answer.  "I only have access to public records, of course, but he doesn't seem to be particularly cutthroat.  His manufacturing concerns are simply more efficient than his competitors, likely due to proprietary techniques.  Koloman Industries applied for 1500 patents last year alone."\u000a\u000a"Thanks."

If there was a way out of the afterlife's simulated purgatory, I didn't want to appear too eager to learn about it and scare the guy off.\u000a\u000a"Ordinarily, yes.  These circumstances were different - the contract I'd written up for our placement into the simulation, it covered both of us, but only //both// of us.  We had to arrive at the same time."\u000a\u000aA slow frown came over his face.  "I anticipated that I would die first.  I did not want to spend an eternity waiting in a simulated world for my daughter to join me.  It seemed... unseemly to silently hope for her death so that she might live with me again."  He scoffed.  "So the contract stated that the first to die would be placed in storage."\u000a\u000a"And it was her."  I tried to say this as neutrally as I possibly could.  In truth, I was reeling from the fact that he'd not only lost his daughter recently, he was losing her for the second time.\u000a\u000a"It was."  He replied quietly.  He'd slipped into the somber mood I'd noticed whenever we got on the topic of how his daughter had been in life.  "Undiscovered heart valve problem.  I spent fifteen years in the outside world, waiting for my time to come so that I might join her."\u000a\u000aHe sighed, then looked back up at me.  "When I did, when I came here, the first face I saw was hers.  She told me about her dreams in Storage, how she'd seen the simulation for what it truly was, and it was beautiful and horrible, awful in the old sense of the term, like a fire that could consume a city."\u000a\u000a"I thought Storage was just... storage."  Once again, my newness to the situation was showing.  "You're shipped to some tape backup under a mountain or something."\u000a\u000a"It is."  Koloman confirmed.  "Not exactly as you described, but near enough.  You cannot dream in storage, because there is no 'you' to dream!  These were earlier days of the simulation, and I worried that my Iva had been one of those afflicted by the upload.  But aside from her newfound passion for art, there were no signs."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_koloman]]\u000a

V"She did."  He smiled fondly.  "All artists, of course, but they were genuinely enthusiastic for her work.  She'd always had the knack of being able to steer away from those who were only after her money.  What she was left with were genuine friends.\u000a\u000a"She was dating... someone."  he waved dismissively.  "I do not remember his name.  I met him once, he seemed truly affectionate but..." his face screwed up in concentration.  "I am trying to find a diplomatic way of saying he was not good enough for her.  I am failing."\u000a\u000a"You think he had anything to do with-" I started.\u000a\u000a"No.  He was //unambitious//."  Koloman said this as though he'd finally found the word he was looking for.  "He truly cared for her, but he was satisfied in his tiny New Detroit apartment, with his small artistic career that barely sustained his time.\u000a\u000a"This is the case for all her friends.  They believed in her work - I believe most recently they'd become a theater troupe under her direction - but none of them had aspirations higher than performing plays."  Koloman shook his head.  "It is not something I can understand."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_koloman]]\u000a

V"Who am I?" this time she did look at me.  "Who the fuck are you?"\u000a\u000aIt took me a moment to realize this was not a rhetorical question.  "Sam Hallivert.  I'm a PI investigating the Koloman case."\u000a\u000aThe woman snorted derisively and went back to her previous stance of not looking my way.  "PI, shit."  She shook her head and did not explain her comment further.  I was pretty sure I wouldn't have liked the explanation anyway.\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_cop]]\u000a

VIva's body was still in a way I'd never seen anything behave before<<if $seenComaCarl>>, other than Coma Carl<<endif>>.  She was like a photograph - not only was her body not moving, but nothing about her moved.  Even the dress she was wearing was suspended in place.\u000a\u000aI turned the seldom-used forensic portions of my brain on.  There were no cuts or bruises.  No sign of a struggle.  That said, she also didn't appear to have died in her sleep - her eyes were wide open and I didn't want to touch her to try to close them.  Her legs were ramrod straight next to each other and her arms had adopted a similar posture at her sides.  She looked like the most realistic mannequin ever invented.\u000a<<display "morgue_actions">>

VTo call the outdoors 'sunny' or even 'well-lit' was of course a drastic overstatement, but the phrases didn't seem as wrong when compared to the grey interior of the Arcade.\u000a\u000aThe top level - which I was on - featured a lot of posters, maps, directions, and double doors.  It seemed almost like an airport:  advertisements for destinations and the companies that made them on every surface.  The hurry-up-and-wait pace of the many lines I'd seen formed only reinforced this idea.\u000a\u000aA vertical slab of otherwise undecorated surface in the center of the room served as a map.  According to it, the lines were for the full-immersion games (a great deal cheaper here than on the outside, given that everyone was effectively already in one).\u000a\u000aBeyond the crowds, toward the back of the arcade, was an elevator.  It was near-abandoned in comparison to the crush elsewhere.\u000a\u000a* [[Enter the elevator|games_elevator]]\u000a* [[Exit the Arcade|games_exterior]]\u000a

She came to the club thinking the whole "we don't hack" thing was a cover."<<set $heardNoHacking=1>>\u000a"How long did it take her to realize you weren't kidding?"  I still wasn't entirely sure the excuse wasn't a cover myself.\u000a\u000a"A few months.  By then, she'd made friends with everyone here.  It was a unique experience - we're a club for people who like to play games, and in comes a person who's incredibly creative but who's never so much as played checkers.  The old grognard types didn't like it, but everyone else?  Nothing they like more than showing a newbie the ropes."\u000a\u000a"So what happened?"\u000a\u000a"She arranged a field trip to Metaverse, and nobody wanted to go."\u000a\u000a"Wait, nobody?"  I frowned.  Given the low production values of New Detroit, I'd figured anyone given a chance to get out would jump at it.  "I know it's pricey, but-"\u000a\u000a"It's not the cost."  Chivalry said.  "Iva wasn't the kind of person who lorded their money over you.  She was the kind of person who wanted to use it to make things a bit better.

It's full of programming types, sure, but that includes the unsavory element, the people who think it's a blast to take down the whole system and make everyone have to get restored from backup.  It's bad enough we have to include 'not real hackers' in all our literature, to actually go to Metaverse where they all live and come back?  We'd probably lose our lease on this place, and that's for starters."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_club]]\u000a

VI kept my eyes peeled - my reflexes may have suffered in their transition to a digital world, but my observational habits were still in place.  Long practice had honed my ability to tell who to avoid and who would avoid me.  Hell, just the act of looking more attentive was scaring away some of the scavengers.\u000a\u000aThe PvP zones had the feel of a post-apocalyptic wasteland, except the buildings were all perfectly undamaged.  Still, most were uninhabited.  Everyone looked at everyone else furtively, sizing each other's threat potential.\u000a\u000aOne place stood out as actually being active:  The large neon "Motor Casino" sign and poorly-animated neon roulette wheel indicated what was likely the only actual business operating in the zone.\u000a\u000a* [[Head back to the train station|train_exterior]]\u000a* [[Enter the casino|casino_interior]]\u000a

VTwo large, angry-looking people were on the other side of the door to greet me.  Non-physical-world Gamers had a stereotype of weakness for over a century, but these two were doing their best to make up for lost time.  They were taller and stronger-looking than I was, and I'd been no slouch in life.\u000a\u000aA woman stood between them, ignoring their presense entirely, instead looking at me.\u000a\u000a"We didn't do it." she stated simply.\u000a\u000a"I hope you realize I can't exactly take your word for it."  I replied.\u000a\u000aShe nodded and gave the bouncers a look.  They walked back into the somewhat larger room that formed the foyer of the club, but didn't take their eyes off of me.\u000a\u000a"As a show of good faith." she said, handing me a card.  It read simply: "Hacker's Club".\u000a\u000a<<set $cardHackers=1>>"My name's Chivalry." she motioned for me to follow her further into the club as she walked.  The greeters did not follow.\u000a\u000a"Is that your actual name or like a gamer name?"  I asked.  My life had been a detective story, I hadn't found much of a need to play one in a game and so didn't know much about the culture.\u000a\u000aChivalry laughed quietly.  "Actual name, I'm afraid.  I think my parents meant to name me 'Chastity' or 'Charity' or something and got it wrong."\u000a\u000aWe walked for a bit.  The hacker's club was a long, nearly featureless, hallway so far.  Other than the greeters sitting on a bench by the entrance and Chivalry, I hadn't seen anyone else.\u000a\u000a"Here we are." she said, pushing open a door I hadn't noticed.

V<<set $clubInPerson=1>>The Hacker's Club was a basement for some reason.  Folding chairs surrounded several folding tables.  Few electronic games were being played; instead I saw a number of board or dice games.  At least one group was involved in what I was pretty sure was some kind of pre-immersion Dungeons and Dragons game.  Two people off to the side were playing Chess, and not even the newer select-your-own-army version.\u000a\u000aChivaly stood on the bottom step, surveying the group.

VBefore Chivalry could answer the question, someone from the back of the room spoke up.  "Give him the flyer!"  A chorus of muted laughter went through the room.\u000a\u000aChivalry rolled her eyes, then explained.  "Sorry about that.  He's referring to our recruitment materials.  I don't think I actually have one with me, but one of the headers is "Why doesn't the Hacker's Club hack?""\u000a\u000a"And why doesn't it?"\u000a\u000aChivalry smiled.  "Because it's illegal.  Something big went down early on in the sim's history - hacker's club wasn't even involved - and ever since then the gal upstairs has been restricting programming activity.  Got it all labeled as 'hacking'.  They say it 'undermines the stability of the simulation'."\u000a\u000a"Wait, you can't even program?  Who makes the games?"  I gestured upward.\u000a\u000a"Metaverse, mostly."  Before I could ask for clarification, she filled me in.  "That's another sim, full of programming types.  It's all allowed over there, but it's not exactly cheap.  Preservers will Store you for free, and getting a policy to set you up in New Detroit  for a few years is actually pretty affordable if you're not going to die for a while."\u000a\u000a"Why not change the name?"  I asked.\u000a\u000aChivalry looked into the distance where the initial heckler's voice had come from as though to pre-emptively silence it.  Then she turned back to me.  "Yeah, that's in the flyer too."  She shrugged.  "The name's got a history.  We're not the same as we were, but it still means something to be a member of the Hacker's Club."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_club]]\u000a

VMarcus nodded, no sign of his earlier anxiety over the topic.  "I suppose..." he said slowly.  "Though if it kills you like it did her, I'm never saying anything to anyone ever again, do you understand?"\u000a\u000aI did, all too well.  I was following in Iva's footsteps, and they'd lead down a dangerous path.  I could only hope that this wasn't the particular fork that'd killed her.  I motioned for him to continue.\u000a\u000a"I was never supposed to come out of storage."  He began.  "At least, not until the promised day of the Preservationists.  My husband - Jacob - and I had insurance policies that guaranteed us a spot in Storage.  He was the actual believer, I simply signed up to make him happy and in case it turned out to be real."  He gestured around himself.  "Good thing I did, hm?\u000a\u000a"I died, and they put me in storage.  Jacob died about five years later, but something went wrong with the upload process.  More wrong than usual - he was... corrupted.  They couldn't re-build his mind on this side."\u000a\u000aI nodded.  It seemed there was more than one reason that Marcus had gone into upload-related psychology.\u000a\u000aMarcus was too involved in telling his story to notice my reaction.  "There was a civil suit by his next of kin - his brother.  I was called on as a witness, though even now I don't really know why.  But they pulled me out of storage to testify.  After the settlement, I could afford to live here in New Detroit.  Hell, I could afford to live in New Phoenix, but... well it's less real down here.  It hurts less."\u000a\u000aHe paused, a sad remembrance over his features.  I got the feeling I was dredging up memories he hadn't reflected on in a long time.  I tried to change the subject "And the dreams?"\u000a\u000aMarcus sighed.  "The dreams.  I died in a hospital - I was a smoker, if you can believe such a thing still existed.  So when I woke up in the hospital, I didn't even know anything was wrong.  The first clue should have been that I could walk.  The second clue should have been the fact that I didn't need to breathe.  But I didn't even think about those things, because it's a dream, you know?  You don't question a dream unless you've trained yourself to.\u000a\u000a"I didn't recognize anyone.  The doctors were different, the patients were different.  Jacob, who'd never left my side in those last hours, was gone.  I walked unfamiliar floors in an unfamiliar layout.  I was in a hospital, but it wasn't mine."\u000a\u000aHe glanced up at me.  "Later, after they woke me up, I worked at the retirement home.  It was the place I'd dreamed.  At the time, I rationalized it, I let myself believe that I'd planted the false memory of the retirement home in my mind.  But now?"\u000a\u000aHe shrugged, looking away.  "I don't know what to believe.  Did I dream a place that not only had I never seen before, but wasn't even real?  I couldn't have.  It's impossible."\u000a\u000aHe turned his eyes toward the television.  "But I saw on the news about Iva.  The impossible's already happened."<<set $fullMarcus=1>>\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_marcus]]\u000a

Iva came to me shortly after she'd moved here to New Detroit."  He trailed off.\u000a\u000a"I hope there's more that doesn't fall under confidentiality."  I said wryly.\u000a\u000a"There isn't."  He answered simply.  "The woman changed my life, and what I've told you is all I can say."\u000a\u000aI was reconsidering my previous decision not to push when he continued.  "No, there is more.  I'm the one who got her her job."\u000a\u000a"Writing plays?"  I asked.  I hadn't thought that was the sort of field that needed an introduction.\u000a\u000aMarcus looked as confused by my question as I'd felt asking it.  "No, volunteering!" He clarified.  "She worked at the retirement home.  If you ask me, she was looking for more people like her, people who'd dreamed in their storage.  People who'd gotten locked up rather than pretend it hadn't happened."\u000a\u000aI raised an eyebrow - that seemed like the sort of confidential information he'd just decided he couldn't give me.\u000a\u000a"She never said that."  Marcus said in response to my unspoken criticism.  "And it's not a diagnosis.  Just a gut feeling."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_marcus]]\u000a

VMarcus shrugged.  "I'm not sure how much I believe it anymore, but I've got the official word memorized if you want to hear it."\u000a\u000aI motioned for him to continue.\u000a\u000aHe took a breath.  "There are actually two kinds of storage - short term and long term.  Long-term storage is what most people think of - your entire mind is written to a few redundant tapes and shipped to different regions for backup."\u000a\u000a"Did you say tapes?"  I knew that New Detroit's whole theme was old-fasioned, but I had no idea that extended to their backup technology.\u000a\u000a"Oh, yes.  According to what I was told, tapes are more reliable, take up less space, and have decades of shelf life."\u000a\u000aI wasn't sure I believed it, but I wasn't an expert.  I didn't think Marcus was either, but I'd asked him to parrot the company line and I was clearly getting what I asked for.\u000a\u000a"Anyway, that's long-term.  Short term is your ordinary computer storage that you'd save stuff off to.  It's on-site - in case you change your mind or circumstances change or they need you for some reason.  Doesn't happen much, but it's part of the system that's been in place this whole time so they never got around to replacing it."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_marcus]]\u000a

VMarcus laughed.  "That's the question, isn't it?  I can give you the company line, if that's what you're looking for."\u000a\u000a"I'd like the truth." I answered simply.\u000a\u000a"Wouldn't we all?  But honestly, at this point, I've got no goddamn idea what the truth is.  I can tell you what the company line is, and then I can tell you what I think."\u000a\u000aI nodded.  That was enough for me.\u000a\u000a"Okay, official statement:  The human mind was not meant to be stored or, for that matter, uploaded."  he began.\u000a\u000a"Hold on."  I hadn't meant to interrupt this early, but already this wasn't making sense.  "This whole sim was made by Preservationists, right?  Isn't their whole philosophy about how we're all meant to ascend this way?"\u000a\u000aMarcus blinked at me as though this was a total non-sequitur.  "Uploads pre-date this sim, <<print $gender>> Hallivert.  The official line I'm giving here isn't Preservationist."\u000a\u000a"Ah, continue."\u000a\u000a"Anyway, the mind's not meant for storage or uploading.  To clarify, I don't mean this in a //moral// way, just in a the-brain-never-evolved-for-this sort of way.  Same reason there were so many car accidents near the turn of the century, the human brain was never meant to comprehend travel at hundred kilometers an hour."\u000a\u000a"You don't have to tell me."  I replied.  "That's exactly how I got killed."\u000a\u000a"But the brain is nothing if not adaptable.  So in the face of something it cannot understand, like uploading, it will invent something that makes sense.  For many people, especially those who first were uploaded, that something was dreams.  They hadn't //died//, they'd merely fallen asleep for a time.  Much easier to understand."\u000a\u000a"They remembered dreaming."  I pointed out.  Somewhere in Ivy's notes had been a half-organized dream journal, though I hadn't checked to see if it dated back to before she'd been pulled out of storage.\u000a\u000a"Memories are lies, <<print $gender>> Hallivert.  It's something the psychological community has known for over a century now.  It's shockingly easy for someone to remember something that, simply put, never occurred.  As an example, doctors had to be careful not to accidentally implant memories in their patients, and this was in the days //before// fully-immersive environments."\u000a\u000aI thought on this for a moment, then changed the subject before I could start doubting my own memories too much.  "You said you'd tell me what you thought, too."\u000a\u000aHallivert smiled weakly.  "I do not know.  It may not sound like much, but you did not know me as I once was.  Strong, certain that I was in the right, that I was helping people get past the false memories of Storage.  To admit that I do not know... it puts my entire life's work in question."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_marcus]]\u000a

V"Why of course!"  Marcus seemed surprised that I hadn't already realized that for myself.\u000a\u000a"Do you believe they were real?"\u000a\u000aMarcus shrugged.  "I'm a lot less certain of their falsity than I once was."\u000a\u000a"What were they?"\u000a\u000aI'd asked Marcus a number of questions at this point, and he'd been open and vaguely friendly the entire time.  This question he shrank from, as though I'd suddenly touched a hot iron to his arm.  He shook his head emphatically.\u000a\u000a"I was a psychologist in life, as well."  He said finally.  I wasn't sure if he was reluctantly answering me or changing the subject.  "So when I came to this world only to be told that I had myself suffered a delusion, well, it was music to my ears!"\u000a\u000a"That's probably not a common reaction."  I commented.\u000a\u000a"No, indeed.  I could recognize the dreams for what they were, though - the false memories the unconscious parts of my brain generated to bridge the gap between my last life and my current one.  But I was fascinated by this expression and all the other side-effects of early upload.  So I changed my specialty, became the counselor that Iva saw."\u000a\u000aThere was a long pause.\u000a\u000a<<sugarchoice "marcus_fulldream" "Can you tell me what you dreamed?">>\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_marcus]]\u000a

VThe many, many scattered notes were hand-written and exhibited no organization whatsoever.  A selection of them included notes from her various trips:  An off-grid journey to Metaverse, a meeting in the Hacker's Club.  Strangely, some parts of the notes were blurred into unreadability, as though water had been spilled on them.  That scenario would have been more likely if I'd seen so much as a single drop of water in the entire simulation.\u000a\u000aOne vaguely-related pile was a dream diary - worryingly, she described walking home from the destinations in her dreams, as though she'd somehow actually ended up there.  <<if $accidentallyTeleported>>Of course, the exact same thing had happened to me.  /%%/<<endif>>Iva seems to have come to the conclusion that she'd teleported somehow rather than walking.\u000a\u000aIn the lowest strata of mess was a small business card belonging to "Emil Ormonde".  It had no information other than his address, but that was enough for me.  I tried to take the card and failed - it simply refused to go into my wallet.  Apparently they wouldn't work unless they were given.  It was an annoying quirk but one I could work around:  Ormonde apparently lived one building down from the one I was in, and it wasn't as though "Apartment 222" was hard to memorize.<<set $hasBoyfriendAddress=1>>\u000a\u000a* [[Examine the desk further|ivahouse_desk]]\u000a* [[Turn your attention back to the living room|ivahouse_interior]]\u000a\u000a

They //should// have been there.  It was an assertion I had no way of proving.  For all I knew Iva had a bad habit of going up to the New Amsterdam beaches and making a mess of her script.  She might have inserted blank pages at spots she felt needed more work.\u000a\u000aMy mind came up with a dozen innocuous reasons for the script to be the way it was, and I knew all of them were wrong.\u000a\u000a* [[Examine the desk further|ivahouse_desk]]\u000a* [[Turn your attention back to the living room|ivahouse_interior]]\u000a

V<<if $nftTroupe>>\u000aThe theater troop's reaction to my reappearance seemed divided.  On the one hand, most were happy to see me.  On the other, some were afraid.  Maybe because the fact that I was here meant that what had happened to Iva was real.  Maybe they just feared I was bringing them more bad news.  Either way, they were talkative.\u000a<<else>>\u000a<<set $nftTroupe=1>>\u000aI made my way up to the stage.

They didn't notice me until I hefted myself on to the stage.\u000a\u000a"Who-"  The one I'd figured was the leading man spoke up.  His word broke everyone else's trance and suddenly the entire group was huddled together, watching me warily.\u000a\u000a"My name's Sam Hallivert."  I said.  "I'm a private investigator working for Nickolai Koloman"\u000a\u000aTheir guard lowered, but not as much as that news usually did.  "Is this about what happened to Iva?" one of the women said from the back of the group.\u000a\u000a"Yes."  I replied.  "I'm here to find out who did it, and how to stop it from happening again."  Brave words that I wasn't entirely sure that I could back up, but it didn't matter - the kids needed reassurance.\u000a\u000aWith that the group's guard lowered entirely, and they all spoke up in a babble; half directed at me and half among themselves.\u000a<<endif>>\u000a\u000a<<display "convo_troupe">>\u000a

V"Emil" the leading man said.  For once only one person had answered the question.  "He's not part of the cast, he's crew."  He glanced back to the group.  "We haven't seen him all week."\u000a\u000aBefore I could ask the requisite follow-up, one of the understudies spoke.  "He didn't do this."\u000a\u000aThe previous lack of babble and discourse ceased, and I was again awash in the sound of a dozen people talking over each other.  I got the gist very quickly:  Emil genuinely cared for Iva, he was happy being crew, he had no reason to hurt her.\u000a\u000a"Can I talk to him?" I didn't yell, precisely, but this wasn't my first time on a stage.  I knew how to project.\u000a\u000aThe group seemed somewhat nervous about answering my question, as though they weren't confident that their words had swayed me.

V<<if $fullMarcus>>\u000a<<display "koloman_store_me_ok">>\u000a<<else>>"Out of the question."  Nickolai answered automatically.\u000a\u000aI paused, awaiting an explanation, and for a few moments it didn't appear as though I was going to get one.  Koloman looked at me and laughed.  "You're waiting for me to tell you why!"\u000a\u000a"I assume there's some reason."  I replied blandly.\u000a\u000a"I am incredulous because this is common knowledge, but again I must remind myself I hired you for your newness.  Storage is a one-way trip."  he answered simply.\u000a\u000a"Doesn't sound that way."  I said.  "Iva got out."\u000a\u000aKoloman nodded.  "Exactly my point.  She left storage, and she suffered nightmares, sleepwalking, delusions of dreams.  Her entire personality changed, she went from straight-laced accountancy to wild-spirit artistry."\u000a\u000a"So it's a one-way trip //now//." I was beginning to see where my employer was going with this.  "To prevent that kind of thing from happening."  It sounded almost cruel - if Iva had been right, people were dreaming in that infinite storage.\u000a\u000a"Not explicitly for that reason."  Koloman clarified.  "But yes.  Ostensibly, the reason is that voluntarily going into Storage is an important personal choice, one taken only when the simulation itself is no longer sufficient for life.  In this case, the only return is the Preservationist's fabled future where computation is so cheap that everyone can live in a New Providence-style simulation."\u000a\u000aI honed in on the sole important part of his reply.  "Voluntarily?  What about the alternative?"\u000a\u000aKoloman seemed confused.  "You mean running out of time?  Well of course, that happens, especially in New Detroit.  The minimum wage is one day per day, after all, which is only sufficient if you never take a day off.  And of course not everyone is careful with their spending habits."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_koloman]]\u000a<<endif>>

She'd left with her boyfriend, and she hadn't come back to the theater again.\u000a\u000a"At first we weren't that worried."  The leading woman was easiest to hear at the moment.

I was Iva's counselor, but that young woman made me reconsider the career."\u000a\u000a"I heard she wasn't easily swayed from the dreaming thing."  I replied.\u000a\u000aMarcus laughed.  "It wasn't just that!  Though you are right, I couldn't sway her.  In the end, she's the one who changed my mind."\u000a\u000aI had no trouble believing this - she'd enraptured an entire theater ensemble, after all.  This man had supposedly been a professional but that word didn't seem to mean much in New Detroit.  "So you believe she dreamed in storage."\u000a\u000a"No."  He corrected himself again.

VThe portions of the troupe that had been sitting on the stage stood up at this, joining the rest of the group in trying to describe what the play was, until the leading man spoke over all of them:  "Storage."<<set $hasStorageReason=1>>\u000a\u000aThe quiet that came over the group was sudden and shocked, as though he'd broken some taboo.\u000a\u000a"Nathan!" the harsh whisper came from the leading woman.\u000a\u000a"I know, but it's important."  The leading man, apparently Nathan, replied.  He turned away from me to address the group.  "I know we're not supposed to talk about how that's the theme.  Iva even told us it was dangerous.  Well you know what?  Maybe she was right.  That's why the detective needs to know."\u000a\u000aThe group didn't seem entirely swayed, but they didn't voice any objections.  Nathan turned back to me.\u000a\u000aI'd been glancing at the seafaring-themed posters of "Atlantis Rising".  "I don't see the word 'Atlantis' and think of Storage".  I said.\u000a\u000a"It's a metaphor.  Atlantis is 'kept aloft by the dreamers', but a corrupt king takes all the credit.  Sound like anything you know?"\u000a\u000aI shrugged.  I didn't see what any of this had to do with Storage.\u000a\u000aNathan failed to stifle a sigh.  "The dreamers are the people in Storage.  The corrupt king is you-know-who"  He pointed upward to indicate the upper levels.\u000a\u000a"Nickolai?"  I played dumb.\u000a\u000aHe grit his teeth.  "No.  The goddess, the AI that runs this place."\u000a\u000a"Oh, you mean Ath-"\u000a\u000a"Shh!" he cut me off with more energy than I'd seen from anyone in the group.  "She can hear you."\u000a\u000aI had no reason to doubt him, so I didn't press it. Instead I asked the other question that'd been bothering me.  "How do dreamers represent Storage?"<<set $ivaStorage = $ivaStorage + 1>>\u000a\u000aNathan hesitated.  The leading woman spoke up.  "You might as well say it, it's not like you haven't been blabbing secrets so far."\u000a\u000a"Right."  Nathan agreed.  "The people in Storage dream.  That's what Iva always said, that her knowledge of the nature of the system came from her time in Storage, while she dreamed."\u000a\u000a"Okay, I get that the play's a metaphor, but how is anyone else supposed to get that?  Everyone thinks that storage is inert."\u000a\u000aNathan shrugged.  "Not everyone.  Other people have come back from storage, and some of them dreamed, too.  To be honest, I don't think that Iva meant to convince anyone.  I think her aim was to //find// them.  Anyone who'd dreamed while stored would recognize the message of the play."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_troupe]]\u000a

Nowadays failures are so rare that they don't do such things, but they do listen.  If you went to your insurance company and told them that you'd dreamed during your upload, they would not believe you.  They would say it was an artifact of the upload or waking process, false memories created by your brain to patch over noise in the upload."\u000a\u000a"I don't see how that would stop someone-"\u000a\u000a"I am not yet done."  Koloman interrupted without rancor.  "People who are uploaded incompletely or incorrectly are often damaged psychologically.  Their condition can grow worse over time.  Often they are unable to adapt.  What I am telling you, <<print $gender>> Hallivert, is that if people believe that you are such a person, you may well find yourself committed to the retirement home."\u000a\u000aI shuddered.  Based on my fairly limited information, it didn't have a terribly good reputation.  I decided to change the subject.  "Are the dreams real?"\u000a\u000aKoloman looked distracted.  "I would once have said no, absolutely not, there are no dreams.  The words I said to you just then, explaining the false memories, they are the words the doctors said to me to explain my daughter's condition."\u000a\u000aHe looked back to me and spread his hands plaintively.  "But the impossible has happened, and so I must reexamine everything I once believed."\u000a\u000a* [[Point out that Iva probably wasn't the only one who dreamed|koloman_other_dreamers]]\u000a

V<<set $sleepy=1>>"What's wrong, Emil?"  I finally ventured.\u000a\u000a"Listen, I have more to tell."\u000a\u000aI made a gesture.  "I'm listening."\u000a\u000aEmil nodded but didn't seem to hear me.  "You're not like the cop, you actually seem to care about what I have to say, but this... it's weird."\u000a\u000a"I've been here less than a month."  I replied.  "Everything's weird to me."\u000a\u000a"Yeah, but..." Emil changed tactics.  "Have you sleepwalked?"\u000a\u000a<<if $accidentallyTeleported>>I nodded.  "I woke up in the PvP zone, of all places."\u000a\u000aEmil cringed.\u000a<<else>>\u000aI shrugged.  "When I was a kid, a few times-"\u000a\u000a"No, I mean, since you got here?  A lot of people, when they first get uploaded and they're still in the habit of sleeping, they sleepwalk."\u000a<<endif>>\u000a\u000a"Yeah."  I said.\u000a\u000aEmil nodded.  "Iva sleepwalked //all the time//.  I mean, every single night that she slept - and she slept every night too, never broke the habit - she ended up somewhere other than where she started."\u000a\u000aWas that the weird thing Emil was going to tell me?  It didn't seem that far-fetched.\u000a\u000a"I'm not done."  Emil seemed intent on answering my questions before I asked them.  "She'd often call me when it happened.  I started getting suspicious one night when she called me from Bar Ocho."\u000a\u000a"She was sneaking out to the bars?"  It wouldn't be the first time I'd seen that happen, but it didn't seem quite right for the simulation.\u000a\u000aEmil shook his head.  "No, that's it.  She was in bed next to me.  I got up to go to the kitchen, and when I got back she's gone.  And seconds - literally seconds - later, she calls me."\u000a\u000a"Bar Ocho's across town."  I stated the obvious just to make sure I understood.\u000a\u000a"Yes, it is.  And it wasn't a prank call, she was really there, I went there and picked her up.  I cut across the hub and it still took me half an hour."\u000a\u000aI nodded.  "I see how that's strange, but-"\u000a\u000a"It wasn't the last time that happened.  I started paying attention to when she'd disappear and when she'd turn up, and it seemed like it took her almost no time at all.  So one night, as an experiment, I changed the door permissions so she couldn't leave."\u000a\u000aI wasn't sure I liked the sound of that, but I motioned for him to continue.\u000a\u000a"She knew."  he explained.  "I told her about the sleepwalking and she was excited, can you believe that?  She thought she'd stumbled on some truth of the system.  So she was on-board with the experiment, almost too excited about it to sleep so it could start."\u000a\u000a"Let me guess."  I could see where this was going.  "The door didn't stop her."\u000a\u000a"Nope."  Emil's nervousness seemed to increase as he told the story.  "She walked right out.  But that's the strange thing, I don't think she did walk out.  I mean, I remember that she walked out the door, but it doesn't seem right.  Not after what I saw later."\u000a\u000a"So she got past your door security."  I tried to placate him and understand what the hell he'd just said at the same time.  "She'd hung out with hackers, maybe she picked up a thing or to, that's not so weird-"\u000a\u000a"That wasn't the weird thing." he interrupted bluntly.\u000a\u000a* [[Tell him to go on|emil_nervous_2]]\u000a

V"Go on, then." I said.  Now he really had me wondering.\u000a\u000a"Over the next few nights we repeated the experiment.  She couldn't get into my apartment, the door would keep her out.  She couldn't leave the apartment if she was awake.  Just when she was sleepwalking.  And every time she did, my memory of her leaving the apartment gets a little fuzzier.  Once I opened the door after her to follow, and she wasn't there.  She was already at the insurance building."\u000a\u000a"Okay, this is getting weirder."\u000a\u000a"I told you about the last night I saw her, the night before she died."  it wasn't a question.  "I didn't tell you all of it."\u000a\u000a"You were running the experiment?" I ventured.\u000a\u000a"We were going to, but it didn't get that far.  That night, when we were going to bed, she said the last words she ever said to me:  "Wait, I think I've got this.""\u000a\u000aI didn't comment.  If Iva had simply walked out on him right then it wouldn't have been that strange; he was going somewhere with this.\u000a\u000a"She disappeared."  He held up a hand to forestall the objection I wasn't going to raise.  "I don't mean she walked out the door, I mean //disappeared//.  One moment she was standing there and the next she wasn't.  And when I remembered all the other times she'd sleepwalked... it was like I'd made them up.  Like they weren't real.  What I remembered now was that, every single time she'd gone out, she'd actually vanished.\u000a\u000a"I didn't know what to think."  He added after a pause.  "I thought maybe she'd found some trick to make herself fall asleep instantly.  But she never called.  After a while I started looking..."\u000a\u000a"And you found her at her apartment."\u000a\u000a"It was the first place I stopped at." he acknowledged.  "And she was dead.  Completely still."  He looked up again at me, then away, as though he couldn't bear to look me in the eyes.  "I tell myself it wasn't my fault, my experiment didn't do it.  And lots of people sleepwalk, right?  I think the disappearing is a new wrinkle but on the other hand I think the 'walking' part might be something people's minds make up because the disappearing makes no sense."\u000a\u000aHe was right about one thing.

VKoloman spread his hands plaintively.  "You have convinced me of the necessity of such an action, drastic though it is.  Still, I must say no."\u000a\u000aI opened my mouth to object, but he continued.  "It is simply that such a thing is impossible.  You can volunteer to be stored, sign the waivers saying you are tired of life and be put away, but... there is no coming back from that."\u000a\u000a"There are two ways into Storage."  I said, sounding more savvy than I felt.\u000a\u000aKoloman had been thinking along similar lines.  "Bankruptcy has much the same problem.  How are you to gain more time if your mind is not even active to work?"\u000a\u000a"So pay me."  I stated simply.\u000a\u000a"It is not so simple.  If you were officially my employee and receiving a salary, the system would take this into account.  It would not put you into storage, it would simply deduct your living costs from your next paycheck."\u000a\u000a"Am I receiving a salary?"  I asked.  This was news to me.\u000a\u000a"No - our arrangement was a verbal contract, but you can read the legal terms if you wish."  He produced a thick pile of paper I'd never seen before and I couldn't help but to think I should have forseen.  In a simulation where every moment could be recorded, verbal contracts were probably a lot more easily enforced.  "In short, you are paid on performance."\u000a\u000a"I've brought you a fair amount of information.  Does that merit a bonus?"\u000a\u000aKoloman was about to dismiss the idea but seemed to have a sudden change of heart.  "If I were to pay a bonus, it would have to be now, when you give me the information.  But suppose I do not get the information now?"\u000a\u000aHe'd lost me.  "What, the check's in the mail or something?"\u000a\u000a"Exactly."  He produced a small pad of paper and I suddenly had an exact copy.  "Write some information about the case on this paper, it doesn't matter what.  Keep it in your apartment and show no-one."\u000a\u000aI began to see where he was going with this.  "Then you come to my apartment after I'm put on ice and 'find' the information."\u000a\u000a"You will have your bonus then, and they will have no choice but to remove you from storage."  Koloman seemed determined now.  "I will see to that, at least."\u000a\u000aWe were silent, then, the enormity of the plan seeming to become more real.  It was a risk - what had Marcus said about the mind not being meant to be stored?  But others had gone through the same thing and survived.  I could do the same.  Then I'd know for certain.<<set $storagePlan=1>>\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_koloman]]\u000a

V"An astute question."  Koloman replied.  "The system has many safeguards in place to prevent exactly that from happening.  Should you go to the shopping district they would refuse to sell you anything that would drop your balance below a month."\u000a\u000aI shrugged.  "I can wait a month."\u000a\u000aKoloman looked at me, irritated.  "I cannot, <<print $gender>> Hallivert."  He gestured to the contract.  "You must show progress in 30 days, or you are no longer my employee."\u000a\u000aI grit my teeth; I never thought I'd be annoyed at //not// being able to foolishly blow away my bank account.  "So how do I get rid of //all// my time?"\u000a\u000aKoloman's expression had not softened, but his irritation no longer seemed focused on me.  "There is a... place in New Detroit.  It is not a pleasant area - it is made to those who have died and did not find that a sufficiently frightening experience.  That is the only place in the entire simulation where you may be harmed, which means it is the only place you can harm yourself."\u000a\u000aThis entire plan was beginning to feel a little too suicicde-ish for my tastes.\u000a\u000aIf my employer noticed my discomfort, he did not comment on it.  "Go to the train station.  Cross the tracks there.  You will feel a sensation of dread; that is normal.  It is there to scare away people of lesser resolve who should not be there.  Continue on until you reach the casino."\u000a\u000aI smiled, reassured that at least it wasn't going to hurt.  "They'll let me bet it all?"\u000a\u000a"Exactly.  It is the only casino that will do so.  Go to it, lose your money, write some gibberish on the note that sounds relevant before they come for you."  Koloman said.  The plan sounded slightly less insane coming from him.\u000a\u000aThat didn't mean it sounded like a //good// plan, of course, but it was the best I had.\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_koloman]]\u000a

VI walked out of the casino and nearly tripped - rather than taking me to the street outside, I found myself in Guillory's office.<<if $mugged>>I was beginning to wonder how many times the insurance company would end up teleporting me away from the PvP areas.<<endif>>\u000a\u000a"<<print $gender>> Hallivert..." Guillory looked extremely uncomfortable.  "Your time balance appears to have reached zero."\u000a\u000a"I was a gambling addict in life."  I lied, and Guillory seemed to know I was lying, but so far as I could tell he had no idea why I'd done what I had.\u000a\u000aGuillory frowned.  "Do you know what happens next?"  There was concern in his voice.  He'd been eager, when I first asked him about Storage, to reassure me that it was nothing to fear.  The reality appeared to be quite different.\u000a\u000a"I get backed up somewhere and wait for the next next life."  I feigned nonchalance.\u000a\u000a"Yes.  When you leave this office, the system will cease simulating you here.  You will be stored."\u000a\u000aA sudden unwanted chill came over me.  When I'd first arrived, I'd had to wait for Guillory to finish talking with someone before I could see him... but nobody had ever left his office.  I imagined him saying those same words to some other unfortunate that would walk out of a door they'd never see the other side of again.\u000a\u000aNo.  This was the plan.

Interestingly enough, it was a dull black rotary like the one that'd woken me up what seemed like an eternity ago.\u000a\u000a"She'll be with us in a moment"  The receptionist said finally, after hanging up.\u000a\u000a"Who is Coma Carl," I voiced one of the questions, "and why do I need to be escorted to see him?" came another.\u000a\u000aBefore I could get an answer, Nurse Fletcher came around the corner.  "<<print $gender>> Hallivert, I understand you're here by the behest of one of the home's patrons?"  Her tone was formally polite, but had an undercurrent that communicated her dislike for the sort of management politics she was now having to deal with.\u000a\u000a"He's here about Iva."  the receptionist said, almost as an aside.\u000a\u000a"Oh."  Nurse Fletcher's professional manner disappated - her shoulders fell, the carefully constructed mask of formality she'd contorted her face into relaxed - she looked like an ordinary if tired person suddenly.  "My apologies, detective.  It has been a trying time; everyone here loved Iva.  Reporters have been attempting to get an official statement on the cause from us this entire week.  When I heard that Mr. Koloman was throwing his weight around, I thought it would be to a journalist."\u000a\u000aI waved away the apology.  "Perfectly understandable."  I said even if I didn't feel it.\u000a\u000aNurse Fletcher nodded.  "Thank you.  In any case, you'll likely want to see Coma Carl.  Come meet me at the elevator when you're ready.  Feel free to talk to whoever you'd like, but I'd warn you against talking too closely to the Greeter if you see her.  She's... complicated."\u000a\u000aWith those confusing words and no explanation, she walked down the hall and away from the reception area.\u000a\u000a* [[You had more questions|convo_asylum]]\u000a

I'll signal the outside this way.  And once that's done?  I mean, I know my real body is dead, but simulating minds in a computer is possible, it's being done right now.

V"You're making me feel old, Hallivert."  she said, shaking her head.

I replied.\u000a\u000a"I'm young in spirit and in avatar."  She confessed, "but old in one particular way:  I absolutely cannot resist the urge to talk about the good old days.  Pull up a chair."\u000a\u000aI was about to object that there weren't any other chairs for me to pull up, but of course then there were.  Well, it was a stool, but it'd get the job one.  I pulled it up.\u000a\u000a"I suspect you might have asked some of the residents of the asylum here what their experience in the olden days was, and I suspect you did not get a very useful answer."\u000a\u000aI didn't reply; I got the feeling she was mostly being rhetorical at this point.\u000a\u000a"That's not because they're holding out on you."  She continued.  "It's because the early days were a shitshow.  We weren't always the biggest sim, but we were one of the first, and so we had to pioneer half the uploading techniques that are common today.  Didn't always get it right.  If you've been to the fifth floor, you know what I'm talking about."\u000a\u000a"But it got better."  I gestured to our surroundings.\u000a\u000a"That's the strange thing."  She said.  "It didn't, at first.  It got //worse//.  Preservationists wanted everyone saved, so they let anyone in, and the more people we let in the worse the errors got.  Got to the point where the entire system started glitching."\u000a\u000aI gestured again to the beach, the surf and the sand.  "But it did get better."\u000a\u000aGreeter nodded.  "It did.  The thing is, nobody knows //how// it got better.  Nobody remembers it.  A lot of my memory's missing due to various compromises and safeguards that have been put into place over time, but this particular change is missing from everyone's memory.\u000a\u000a"The official story is that they brought Storage online and that stabilized everything."  She shrugged.  "Sounds reasonable to me."\u000a\u000a* [[Ask more questions|convo_greeter]]\u000a

One of those is that I lose memories."\u000a\u000a"Do you know what you've lost?"  I asked gingerly.\u000a\u000aShe shrugged.  "I remember that I did hide someone, a long time ago.

V"There's the door" She gestured.\u000a\u000aI glanced back at the area of the beach I'd fallen into.  There was a door standing on the beach, hanging open.  Through it, I could see the halls of the retirement home I'd left.  <<if $hasCalledNurse>>Nurse Fletcher paced the halls worriedly, glancing into the door every so often.  If she saw me, she gave no sign.<<endif>>\u000a\u000a"This place looked empty from the other side."  I observed.\u000a\u000a"Yup.  Did that on purpose."  she said.

This conversation's private."\u000a\u000a"Is that something you have to do often?"\u000a\u000aShe shook her head.  "Nah, most people aren't worth the trouble.

VGreeter laughed.  "I'm going to just come right out and admit this - watching people walk through that door and fall on their ass into the sand never //ever// gets old."\u000a\u000a"No, I mean, how am I on a beach-"\u000a\u000a"I know, I know."  Greeter still seemed to be trying to hold back laughter.  "Welcome to my slice of the grid, Hallivert.  This is the ocean," she gestured as she spoke, "this is my beach chair, and this is my endless drink." she illustrated the latter by drinking it.\u000a\u000a"I don't understand."  I understated.\u000a\u000a"Okay."  Greeter sat up in her chair and spun to face me.  "When I said that I've been here since the beginning, I mean that I've been here since the //beginning//.  The computers you are now simulated on belong to me.  That's why nobody outside can pull you out, that's why they can't even move my room.

VGreeter laughed.  "Exactly!  Why go to that locked down reality-like experience when I can have a non-stop beach party?"\u000a\u000aHer smile faded somewhat.  "It's more than that, though.  The beach party isn't the only thing this area can do.  These are my computers, I can make them do whatever I want.  Out there I'd just be a nobody, and... there's more."\u000a\u000aShe looked at me solemnly for a moment before continuing.  "The dreams would take me away."\u000a\u000aI shrugged.  "I'd say that sounds crazy, but I did just walk directly from a hallway to a deserted island."\u000a\u000aGreeter smiled again.  "I'm glad to see you've got some perspective.  I don't even know what that sentence means, 'the dreams would take me away', but I know it's true, so..." she trailed off, shrugging.  "I stay here.  It's a blast."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_greeter]]\u000a

V"I am a hacker in the //very// old meaning of the term.  Originally, the word didn't have the negative connotations it doesn't have today."  She grinned at me.  "Keep looking at me like that and I'll change this beach party to a classroom, it'd serve you right."\u000a\u000aWhatever look I'd reconfigured my face into apparently didn't pass muster, because without even a transition, I was seated at a bench in an old-style one-room schoolhouse.  Greeter stood - still in her swimsuit and holding her drink - at the chalkboard, where the word "hacker" was written.\u000a\u000a"A hacker", Greeter said in her best teacher-sounding voice, "is a person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities."  Her authority was only somewhat undercut by the bathing suit.\u000a\u000a"The old definition."  I said.\u000a\u000a"Ahem.  <<print $gender>> Hallivert, in this classroom we raise our hands before we speak."\u000a\u000aWhen I'd gone to school, I'd buzzed in when I wanted to talk, but judging from my surroundings we were going by a far older standard.  I raised my hand.\u000a\u000a"<<print $gender>> Hallivert?" Greeter called on me.\u000a\u000a"That's the old definition?"  I repeated myself.\u000a\u000a"Yes, <<print $gender>> Hallivert.  It is by that definition that I am a hacker.  I helped build this simulation - that is why my computers are part of it, and though they're generations behind the main sim as you can tell they still get the job done."\u000a\u000a"You're the first programmer I've seen in this place."  I replied, keeping my hand up just in case.\u000a\u000aShe nodded.  "Strange, isn't it?  Hacker types like me love simulated afterlives."\u000a\u000aShe made a gesture and the classroom vanished, replaced once more by the beach paradise.  "Class dismissed."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_greeter]]\u000a

V"Great girl."  Greeter said.  "She brought the people here food, always good for a conversation.  She listened to the nurses and never came in here, though, so I couldn't show her a party like this one." she took a drink to emphasize this last point.  "But, overall, great girl."\u000a\u000aI didn't want to ask the next question, but I had to.  "You seem much more powerful than almost anyone else in this sim, and that includes Koloman."\u000a\u000a"Thank you," Greeter's response was cool, she knew I was going somewhere with this.\u000a\u000a"So I have to ask.  Did you kill Iva?"\u000a\u000aGreeter shook her head.  "I understand that you have to ask the question.  No, I did not kill Iva.  She never entered the room and, believe me, with my reputation they keep a careful log of everyone who enters the room.  You can't see cameras in the sim but they're here, and one of them is trained on my door.  So feel free to check the logs."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_greeter]]\u000a

VI turned to walk back along the beach to the strange doorway that would, I hoped, bring me back to the slightly more sane world of the asylum.\u000a\u000a"Wait" Greeter said from behind me.  I turned and she was standing immediately in front of me.  I hadn't heard her stand up, but then again it wasn't as though she needed to.  \u000a\u000a"Before you go." she started without apology for nearly startling me backward through the door.  "You should know something.  Some of my memory's gone because it was taken from me.  Some of it is gone due to corruption when the early storage experiments failed.  But some... some I removed //purposely//.  I gave it to people to seed on the outside.  Should I ever be forcibly evicted and forget who I am, they are there, clues to who I was and who was important to me.  I can give you a key to those memories, a way to recognize them when you see them."\u000a\u000a"What's the catch?"  I asked reflexively.  There was always a catch.\u000a\u000a"The last time I spoke to Iva, she stood on the other side of that door and asked me a number of questions very similar to the ones you've asked me.  And I gave her the same information I'm about to give you.  I never saw her again."\u000a\u000aI nodded.  "I'm following in her footsteps anyway."  I glanced down at the sand to make sure this wasn't the literal truth, but apparently the simulation was not high enough fidelity for me to leave footprints at all.\u000a\u000aGreeter nodded and handed a large rusty key over to me.  It vanished the moment I touched it, but I knew I'd find it on my keyring if I looked.\u000a\u000a"Good luck."  Greeter said.<<set $greeterKey=1>>\u000a\u000a* [[Exit|asylum_greeter_exterior]]\u000a
