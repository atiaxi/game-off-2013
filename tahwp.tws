VThe afterlife had wood paneling.\u000a\u000aIt'd ordinarily be an absurd thing to notice.  I was dead, after all, in the hereafter's own waiting room.  You'd think there'd be pearly gates, or at least a hint of brimstone, but instead?\u000a\u000aIt was a waiting room.  Wood paneling on the walls, an oblong receptionist counter complete with bored-looking [[receptionist]] doing her best not to make eye contact... it was only missing some out of date magazines and it'd be perfect.  I'd have to mention it to whoever ran the place.\u000a[[Debug]]\u000a* [[Wait|intro_wait]]

VI made my way up to the receptionist.\u000a\u000a"Sam Hallivert" I said.  "I suppose I have an appointment?"\u000a\u000aThe receptionist looked up at me as though I was barely more interesting than the game of solitaire she'd been cheating at.  "Not as such, no."  She went back to the game.\u000a\u000aI waited for her to continue talking, and she waited for me to sit back down.  She had the advantage of long hours' practice at ignoring waiting rooms, but I was dead.  It wasn't as though I had anywhere else to be.\u000a\u000aShe looked back up.  "Mr. Guillory will see you as soon as he is available.  Please wait your turn."\u000a\u000aI glanced back at the row of four seats that apparently sufficed as a waiting room.  Without me there to provide bulk, they were empty.  I opened my mouth to-\u000a\u000a"He's with a client."  the receptionist said before I could even turn my head back.\u000a\u000aI nodded.

VI was expecting the seats to either be uncomfortably thin or absurdly over-stuffed, in the style of waiting room seats everywhere.  These looked thin but didn't feel it.  They didn't feel like much of anything, to be honest.  I could have been sitting on a box and leaning against the wall and gotten more of a sensory experience out of it.\u000a\u000aThat I was reduced to mentally critiquing the furniture indicated a lot about my [[mental state|intro_mentalstate]].\u000a\u000a* [[Wait|intro_invite_in]]

Wherever I was, it was decidedly low-tech.\u000a\u000a"Sam Hallivert?" he said, looking up and meeting my gaze.

VI shrugged.  I'd gathered I was dead, that the afterlife was poorly decorated, and that angels (or devils, the state of my soul was still up in the air) had names like "Alex Guillory".  Everything else was news to me.\u000a\u000aAlex made a note in my file and nodded.  "Memory can take a while to be re-accessible."  He closed the folder and looked up at me.  "Well, I have answers."\u000a\u000aHe gestured around himself, indicating that I should take in the room.  There wasn't much to see - the same faux-wood paneling on the walls, an uninspired plastic desk, the job plaque I'd noted earlier, a cup of pens.\u000a\u000aI'd been a private investigator in my previous life, though, so I also noticed what wasn't in the room.\u000a\u000aGuillory's desk only had his plaque, the pens, and the manilla folder.  There were no ports to plug anything into, and no ports for output.  The holographic projection interface you'd need if you wanted to use the desk for anything other than putting things on was conspicuously absent.  The desk was either a great deal less advanced than the desks I was familiar with, or a great deal more.\u000a\u000aNow that I was thinking about plugs, ports, and electronics I noticed more:  There were no electronics at all, and the corresponding places where they'd interface were also missing.  No charging stations.  There wasn't even a light switch and, now that I was looking, no /light/.\u000a\u000aI frowned at the last observation.  The room was lit perfectly - there weren't even shadows.  I'd say it was impossible but I'd already done one impossible thing today just by being here.\u000a\u000a* [[Mention the strangeness of this place|intro_bridge]]

V"This place is no insurance agency, that's for sure."  I said, gesturing to his plaque.\u000a\u000aGuillory chuckled.  "Actually, we are."  Opening the folder again, he pulled out a rather large bundle of paper, stapled together.  I hadn't remembered the folder holding that much, but I didn't get the chance to ask before Guillory turned the paper to face me and put it down on the desk.  "This is your policy."\u000a\u000aI wanted to ask Guillory for clarification, but I had the feeling the policy would speak for itself.  Unsurprisingly, it was by the same naggingly familiar "Life Preservers Insurance" and seemed to be pretty standard legalese.

V"The Soulkeeper is you - at least, the you that you are now."\u000a\u000aGuillory saw my nonplussed expression.\u000a\u000a"Well, it's a bit more technical than what I'm about to describe, but simply put, the soulkeeper contains a few hundred billion tiny machines.  These machines are very small - the term 'microscopic' is too large, to give you an idea - such that all these machines can quite easily fit within your head."\u000a\u000aI didn't like where this was going.  Obviously I couldn't argue the end result, but the process was already sounding very uncomfortable.\u000a\u000aThe insurance agent seemed to notice my discomfort.  "It's actually quite noninvasive.  The machines are smaller than even your own brain cells.  That's their job, after all - once implanted, each device finds a nerve to latch on to.  From there, it goes about recording everything.  What causes this nerve to fire?  What levels of neurotransmitters are present at the time it does so?  When does this nerve die, and if this happens what is the cause?  Is there a replacement?"\u000a\u000a"So they learned how to be me."  I observed.\u000a\u000aGuillory nodded.

VThe question made Guillory smile.  "That's somewhat of our mission statement."\u000a\u000a"Life Preservers Insurance," he said with the same air of rehearsed speech he'd had earlier, "was founded to provide people with policies that could be used to keep them alive in this simulation after they'd passed on.\u000a\u000a"That is somewhat of an important point - we are not a traditional insurance company.  We do not insure houses, or health, or even life in the usual manner - though much of the funding that finances your part of the simulation is derived from a life insurance policy.  Instead, we're an insurance company dedicated to getting people to the /next/ life.  This life.\u000a\u000a"In this way, we further <<set $heardOfPreservationists=1>>Preserver goals and, best of all, keep people alive and well."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_guillory]]

V"The process is very technical" Guillory literally handwaved the response.  At least he had the decency to almost immediately realize that I wasn't going to find that a satisfactory answer.\u000a\u000a"Well," he began again, "your soulkeeper <<set $heardOfSoulkeeper=1>>is extracted after your death.  Its patterns are fed into the large banks of machinery that make up this world, and those computers then add your mind to its simulation."\u000a\u000a"Simulation."  I said.  Suddenly the copy-and-paste furniture made a great deal more sense.\u000a\u000a"Yes.  I don't know your religious leanings, <<print $gender>> Hallivert, but this is not a spiritual afterlife.  You are currently within the memory and processors of nearly five thousand top-of the line servers at a data-center in Boulder City, Nevada."\u000a\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_guillory]]

V"Not exactly."  Now that a less professional topic such as religion had come up, Guillory looked a lot less comfortable.  "This company was founded by the Preservationist movement, of course, and a fair amount of stock is still owned by the church.  But-" he held up a finger to stress the point "we don't require that our clients adopt, share, or even entertain such beliefs.\u000a\u000a"Obviously, believing that people should be preserved after they die and working at an agency like this are quite compatible.  Similarly, those that believe in a non-digitizable soul that they will take with them to a true afterlife are unlikely to sign up for our services.  Still, we are open to all."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_guillory]]\u000a

VGuillory smiled widely.  "That's entirely up to you.  You have most of another whole life ahead of you.  Many of our clients dedicate themselves to art, or mastering a skill that they lacked in life.  Many others simply lie back and relax, treating this as an extended retirement."\u000a\u000aHe gestured down to the sheaf of paper on his desk that was my insurance policy.  "The policy you purchased in life gives you fifty years of New Detroit time - more specifically, a little over three million seconds subjectively.  Time flows a little bit differently from city to city, but nothing you'll notice unless you spend a while there, and should you be able to afford that you'll likely have more time than you need anyway."\u000a\u000a"Afford?"  I looked at him skeptically.  There was always a catch.\u000a\u000a"You've no doubt heard the phrase 'time is money'?  Well here it is literally true.<<set $heardTimeIsMoney=1>>  What your policy paid for is enough computing power to simulate you for fifty years at the level of fidelity that New Detroit offers.  That money on the outside became time here.  Time here is a valuable and scarce commodity that cannot be counterfeited.  Your fifty years is currency - a fair bit of it, actually.  I would advise you not to spend it all in one place."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_guillory]]

VA vague grimace game over Guillory's face.  "It's not a scenario we like to discuss - nothing terrible!" He rushed to reassure me despite the fact that I hadn't appeared surprised at all.  "Anyone who runs out of time is simply downgraded to Storage.  We're Preservers, after all<<set $heardOfPreservationists=1>>, we're not going to just delete someone."\u000a\u000aDespite the calming tone, I didn't like the sound of Storage.\u000a\u000aGuillory had anticipated my next question.  "Yes, Storage is what it sounds like.  Your patterns that are currently in simulation now are stored on disk - and also redundantly backed up, of course.  You will no longer be simulated, but of course it's the Preservationist belief that eventually simulation costs will be so low that everyone can be revived for free.  At that point, you'll be returned, likely to this very office."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_guillory]]\u000a

VI stood in front of the Life Preservers Insurance building - a middling grey cube in the sea of middling grey cubes that apparently made up this place.  It was dark - and I very quickly got the impression that it was always dark - but surprisingly quiet for a modern city.  No horns blared, nobody yelled from the window of their car.  There didn't appear to be any traffic whatsoever, that I noticed.

VGuillory consults his notes.  "Looks like you were struck by a car?"  his voice radiates confusion.  \u000a\u000a"I got run over?"  I asked.  It was absurd - cars had dozens of redundant systems designed to prevent the computers that drove them from hitting people.  You could walk across a busy freeway in complete safety, provided you didn't mind heading to court afterward and paying a hefty fine for disrupting traffic.\u000a\u000aGuillory nods.  "Ah, here it is, you were struck by a //non-automatic// car.  Not a lot of people who don't have a self-driving car nowadays, but the hold-outs tend to be rather deluded about how good they are at driving."\u000a\u000aI'd been under the impression that dumb-cars had been finally outlawed years ago.

V<<set $money = $money - 7>><<set $tourInProgress = 1>><<set $ferroInPerson=1>>I looked through my wallet and discovered I had exact change.  Hoping this worked like it did in the real world, I took seven days worth of bills out and handed it over to Samahd.  He smiled and took it, so I must have done something right.\u000a\u000a"All right, let's get started!  Let's see, basic information you need to know:  This is New Detroit, the lowest level of the simulation.  You've probably noticed all the lack of amenities - no shadows, no smells, no heat or cold, sounds don't travel far, lots of things lack texture - you get used to it.  You probably wouldn't even have noticed if I hadn't pointed them out." He grinned prankishly and started numbering things on his hand.\u000a\u000a"First, you can't die here."  There was something in the tone of his voice when he said this, but as usual I couldn't get him to stop long enough to ask.  "Where would you go, right?  Second, you can't be hurt here unless you go into the wrong neighborhood - and you'll know it if that happens.  Third, you can't be robbed - other people can't even //see// your wallet, let alone take anything out of it.  This Detroit's a lot safer than the real one, if a lot less scenic."\u000a\u000a"Fourth:  Don't run out of time.  That's a one-way ticket to Storage.  I'd recommend getting a job - even one that pays one day per day is a pretty good gig, keeps you going."\u000a\u000aSamahd looked down at his hands as though he'd forgotten something, then shook his head to dismiss it.  "Anyway, enough about the new motor city in general, let's get specific."\u000a\u000aHe smiled his tour-guide smile and gestured to the Insurance building behind us.  "This, as you're probably already aware, is the Life Preservers Insurance building.  Drop-off point for new uploads fresh off the bus.  They've got customer service agents always ready to talk, they sometimes help with job placement if you're willing to pay for it.  Kinda self-defeating if you ask me, but hey, whatever works."\u000a\u000a"Up this way is the Power of Two."

V"The Power of Two" sounded like it ought to be a bordello, and as I got closer to the building I could tell that this impression was, if anything, understated.\u000a\u000aPosters of naked women covered every available surface of the building, in many cases obscuring each other and in some places overlapping with the neon sign naming the building.  A very few ordinary signs were visible:  One proclaiming "Titanic Tits!" and another in much smaller type explaining that the cover charge to enter was 1 day.\u000a<<if $tourInProgress>>\u000aSamahd gestured to the display and wiggled his eyebrows suggestively.  "I'm not here to judge!".\u000a\u000aGrinning, he donned his tour-guide voice.  "This, as you've probably guessed, is New Detroit's premiere whorehouse.  Athena - that's the AI that runs this sim - doesn't let people just turn their brain's pleasure center on and ignore the world, so sex is still very much a thing!  It's got some benefits over the real thing.  No diseases, nobody can possibly get pregnant, nobody's forced into it because you can't be forced into anything here - it's pretty much the best brothel ever, anywhere."\u000a\u000aHe shrugs.

VBar Ocho looks like someone took the platonic ideal of 'Bar' and copy-pasted it into the city.  Considering the fact that this was a simulated city, that might not have been too far from the truth.  The name of the bar was in neon, as far too many building signs seemed to be.  The "O" in "Ocho" was overlaying a large stylized 8-ball.  I found myself wondering if anyone played pool in New Detroit.\u000a\u000a<<if $tourInProgress>>\u000aSamahd stood to the side of the bar's door.  "For future reference, this is where I am on almost all of my downtime.  I mean, I'll give you my card at the end of the tour, but not everything is business, right?  Sometimes you need to unwind.  That's what this place is for!  The beer's not as effective as on the outside, but the upside is that you can't become addicted to it.  Simulation doesn't allow it.  Great, huh?"\u000a\u000aHe gestured up to the non-buzzing neon sign.  "Oh, another thing.  See that sign?  That's a pun in my language.  'Borracho' means 'drunk'.  Despite the America-centric theme of the city names, there are more languages spoken here than in any other one place on earth.  Turns out translation is only hard for computers when they don't have full access to the mind-state of the people doing the talking.  So if you never got to learn another language in your previous life, don't worry!  You'll never need to!"\u000a\u000aHe stepped away from the door and started walking up the street, pointing to a large vertical column in the distance.  The slightly glowing blue cylinder was far taller than any other building - or anything I'd ever seen in either life.

VEvery other building in New Detroit seemed to have been cut from the same block of concrete.  The Elevator was different.  A sleek blue steel column, it started from ground level and stretched upward into the sky.  I couldn't tell where - if anywhere - it stopped.\u000a<<if $cardKoloman>>\u000a* [[Enter the elevator|elevator_interior]]\u000a<<endif>><<if $tourInProgress>>\u000a"Yeah."  Samahd nodded.  "That's the Elevator, it's how you get to other cities in the same simulation.  It could have been an airport or something, but I think the people who designed it liked the Elevator metaphor.  They're above us that way."\u000a\u000aHe turned back to me.  "Like I said at the beginning, this sim's workable but missing some amenities.  Nothing here takes your breath away, right?"\u000a\u000aI knew he used that phrase on purpose, because I noticed then that I wasn't breathing.  I hadn't been breathing the entire time.  I didn't think I //could// breathe and, most strange of all, this fact did not trigger a panicked choking for survival.\u000a\u000a"Yeah, this stage of the sim, the city we call New Detroit, it's just above the brain-in-a-jar level.  You get most of your brain simulated but almost none of your internal organs.  Cuts down on the overhead of the sim, you can fit more people in cheaply.\u000a\u000a"Ever have a dream that, when you wake up, you realize was utterly absurd?" Again, without waiting for an answer, he continued, "Why didn't you realize it in the dream?  I mean, four-armed gorilla monsters from space aren't even remotely real, but your dream-self doesn't question it.  It's the same thing here.  There's a part of your brain dedicated to constantly asking the question 'does this make any damn sense at all?'.  In dreams, it's shut off.  Here?  It's not even simulated."\u000a\u000aHe gestured back to the column.  "That's not the case everywhere.  The next city up is New Phoenix.  They've got shadows, better physics, more texture, better sound, but still no internals.  It's the same sim, keep in mind that this isn't taking you off-grid or anything, it's just that they dedicate a lot more computing power to NPX.  It costs a lot more too, though - the ratio of New Detroit time to New Phoenix time is about 50:1.  One day's vacation would cost you a couple months.  That scale's just about the same all the way up, too.  Next city's New Amsterdam, and that's fifty times more expensive than New Phoenix.  Top of the pack is New Providence.  It's fifty times more expensive than NA.  I don't know if you've done the math, but that means you could spend a lifetime in a few minutes."\u000a\u000aHe shook his head.  "Too rich for our blood, in other words.  Come on, let me show you the courthouse."\u000a\u000a* [[Follow him|courthouse_exterior]]\u000a<<else>>\u000a* [[Walk to the Courthouse|courthouse_exterior]]\u000a* [[Go to the Hub|Hub]]\u000a* [[Visit Bar Ocho|bar_ocho_exterior]]\u000a<<endif>>\u000a

VThe architects who created New Detroit clearly had an extremely generic template - the Courthouse could not have looked any more the part.  Faux-marble stairs, textured columns, even a statue of justice out front.\u000a\u000a<<if $tourInProgress>>\u000a"You probably will never see the inside of this place unless you decide to become a history buff." \u000aSamahd said.  "Used to be the center of law and order in this place, trials and everything, but it turns out it's easier just to make the sim so crimes can't be committed."\u000a\u000aHe pointed to the flat wall of a convenience store.  "For instance, say you had a spraycan and you felt like tagging your name all over that thing."  He rummaged through his pockets for a moment.  "Damn, I don't have one.  I usually bring one for this demonstration.  Anyway, it wouldn't work.  You don't own that store, you don't have permission to modify it, you can't do anything to it."\u000a\u000aAfter a few more moments he pulled an ordinary-looking keyring from his pocket.  "I'd say 'at least I remembered these' but as it happens they're always with you.  They look like keys - old metal style keys, you've probably noticed the taste for antiques around here - and they act like them, letting you into doors, opening whatever you've locked, that kind of thing.  You've likely got one for your apartment."\u000a\u000aDubiously, I reached into my pocket and pulled out a keyring.  It had one key, featuring the number "1336" emblazoned on it.  I let go and the ring and key vanished.  Patting the outside of my pocket revealed nothing, but reaching in again resulted in the same key.  I hadn't even felt it there.\u000a\u000a"A lot of abstractions work like that - your entry permissions being actual keys, the time-is-money concept being made into real bills.  New Detroit's got an old-time asthetic because there's no point in having it look technological.  We're not only surrounded by technology, we //are// technology.  No need to lug around a holographic projector for your phone when old-fasioned business cards can do the same thing."\u000a\u000aHe shrugged.  "You really do get used to it.

VThe church was one of the few stand-out buildings I'd seen in this city.  Its peaked roof made it taller than most of its neighbors, and the stained glass mural comprising its sole window was possibly the most detailed thing I'd seen in the city, even if I couldn't tell what it was supposed to be depicting.\u000a\u000a<<if $tourInProgress>>\u000a"You a Preservationist?" Samahd, true to character, did not even remotely give me time to reply.  "If so, this is the place for you.  I mean, the whole sim is theirs so I think they figure if you're here you're as good as converted anyway.  But still, if you want to go all-in on the worship thing, these guys have you covered."\u000a\u000aHe took a few moments of precious precious silence to let me look over the building before continuing.  "Obviously, they're rich, but they don't pay much.  I mean, it's a church.  Most people volunteer."\u000a\u000a"Anyway, religion is hard.

VNew Detroit was a full-fledged city, and it was easy to forget that elsewhere.  Here, in the heart of the shopping district, it was obvious.  The hustle and bustle of human movement and conversation was more muted than it'd have been in the real world, but it still managed to be omnipresent.  And as in the real world, shopping seemed to be more popular than any other activity.\u000a\u000a<<if $tourInProgress>>\u000a"I wouldn't go on a spending spree right away!"  Samahd was having to speak up to be heard which, given the unrestrained volume he usually spoke at, was saying something.\u000a\u000aHe lead us toward a marginally more quiet corner of what was essentially a large strip mall.\u000a\u000a"If you want to get a job, this is the easiest place to do it.  Some people order out of catalogs that act like the network-accessible shops you might be used to, but most people figure if they're going to get all old-timey, they're going to do it right.  In-person sales are pretty popular.  It only pays minimum wage - that's an hour per hour - but that'll extend you quite a bit."\u000a\u000aHe leaned back against the wall and people-watched for a while, which mostly forced me to do the same.  Shoppers here seemed focused and uninclined to talk, despite all the babble I heard in the air.\u000a\u000a"Okay," Samahd was apparently done.  "enough regular people.

VThe Arts District was Broadway.  As it turned out, that wasn't a metaphor - someone had taken the entire cityscape of New York's theater district, scaled down the fidelity, mixed it up a bit, and placed it in New Detroit.\u000a\u000aI wasn't sure which, if any, of the details they'd gotten correct, but the neon lights were in fact bright.\u000a\u000a<<if $tourInProgress>>\u000a"Shopping's a good pastime, but if you want more classy sort of entertainment - well, as classy as you're likely to find in this city - the arts district here is the best place to do it." Samahd was standing in front of the Park Theater, which I'd been pretty sure had burned down centuries ago.  People were apparently not the only things that got afterlives.\u000a\u000a"Prices here are pretty reasonable.  Your real theater snobs are all up in New Amsterdam at a far better rendition of this building.  This is bottom floor for artists of all stripes, so you can even catch free shows."\u000a\u000aFinally, after what felt like hours of false starts, I got a word in edgewise.  "I suppose you can get hired on as an usher?"\u000a\u000aSamahd laughed.  "Yes, actually.  Most people here are actors, painters, musicians.  Being an usher would be better work if you could get it.  Everyone wants to start a band but, well, you know the phrase 'starving artist'?  It somehow manages to be true even in a place where you can't possibly starve."\u000a\u000a"Once you're finished with what passes for 'upscale' around here, I'll take you to where the real fun happens."\u000a\u000a* [[Follow him|games_exterior]]\u000a<<else>>\u000a* [[Head toward the Games District|games_exterior]]\u000a* [[Go to the Hub|Hub]]\u000a* [[Go shopping|shopping_exterior]]\u000a<<endif>>

VThe Games District was obvious - it was surrounded by golf courses.  The sudden lack of buildings hanging over me gave me the strange fleeting feeling of agoraphobia.\u000a\u000a<<if $tourInProgress>>\u000a"If you haven't guessed why this is separate from the arts district yet," Samahd said, gesturing to the greens, "it's because it's about three times bigger."\u000a\u000aWe passed a few voleyball courts and a soccer field.  "Every sport on the planet is represented here, and some new ones that you can't do in the real world.  I wouldn't recommend starting with those, by the way."  He pointed to a three-story tall translucent cube that apparently featured rapidly changing gravity as a core game mechanic.\u000a\u000a"You mostly see sports-style games because those take the most room."  He pointed toward a small building off the main road.  "That leads to the arcades, underground.  Every video game we could licence - and with the kind of money the architects were throwing around, it was a lot - is available there, 15 minutes per play.  It ranges from some of the more recent full-immersion games - much easier to play here than in the real world, you don't need a sim implant or anything - to old-style mechanical pinball."\u000a\u000a"Take it from me," he came to a halt at the intersection, "your video game skills, if any, will carry over into this world, but your athletic skills won't.  I was a researcher but played softball on the side.  Couldn't play it at all once I got uploaded.  Game's the same, but you kinda have to re-learn your proprioception."\u000a\u000aThat explained why my reflexes were terrible, at least.\u000a\u000a"Come on, we've got a train to catch."\u000a\u000a* [[Follow him|train_exterior]]\u000a<<else>>\u000a* [[Head toward the train station|train_exterior]]\u000a* [[Go to the Hub|Hub]]\u000a* [[Visit the Arts District|arts_exterior]]\u000a<<endif>>\u000a

If you wanted to visit any of the other sims we're networked to, this is the place."\u000a\u000aHe walked up to the chalkboard.  "Of course, moving all the data that makes up a human being isn't exactly cheap, as you can see, and those prices don't include however much it'll cost to simulate you once you're there.

VA sign outlined in brick proclaimed the building behind the thick iron fence to be the "Shady Acres Retirement Home".  The building itself wasn't exactly welcoming, either.  It looked like a cross between a cheap hotel and a hospital.\u000a\u000a<<if $tourInProgress>>\u000a"You can't get in here without an invite" Samahd leaned up against the also-thick-iron gate.  "And trust me, that's for your own good, not theirs."\u000a\u000aHe gestured to one of the windows.  "Those are the only windows in the city that are one-way.  Special dispensation from Athena, because what's going on in there is not pleasant.\u000a\u000a"Sorry, don't mean to get all spookhouse on you, it's just the place has a bad reputation.  For the most part, it's full of people who've been in the simulation for a very long time, but for whatever reasons don't want to go into Storage.  Lots of people who were in the first wave of uploads, way back when.  It was more experimental in those days, and it didn't always work right.  Plus you've got the people who've got the double bad luck to have died bad and remember their deaths.  Physical trauma is a thing of the past if you stay on the right side of the tracks, but PTSD is forever."\u000a\u000aHe shook his head sadly.  "So yeah, the hospital look is not an accident."\u000a\u000aJust as quickly, though, he seemed to come out of his reverie.  "Well, isn't that a high note to go out on.

V741 McGraw St, Apartment #1336 - I knew it was my home without having to consult any notes, or even having to be told.

"And here we have nearly come full circle.  This is your home, and where our tour ends."\u000a\u000aHe turned to face down the road.  "For reference, this way leads back to the insurance offices, and over there leads to the neighborhood people around here call "The Hub".  It's an easy way to get across the city without having to walk through half the districts, but it's not on the tour because it's boring.  Keep in mind that this is a tour that features an insurance company, so when I say 'boring', I mean //boring//.\u000a\u000a"And finally," with a deft twist of his hand, he produced a business card like the one Guillory had given me.

Likely the exact same paneling, I reflected, if the copy-paste temperment was as pervasive inside as out.\u000a\u000aA large glass double-door lead out to the streets, and a permanently propped open metal door pointed the way to the concrete stairway.

VApartment 1336 was a 55-square-meter studio apartment.  It was sparsely decorated, as I'd assumed an apartment that nobody lived in until now would be, but it was at least furnished.\u000a\u000aA leather-colored [[couch]] took the center stage, sitting across from an irritatingly small 50cm [[television]] that looked like something out of the black-and-white era.  If it didn't get color I was prepared to call bullshit on the entire idea of retrotechnology.\u000a\u000aThe kitchen nook featured a [[refrigerator]] and a few empty cupboards.  So far as I could tell, there was no laundry or bathroom - hopefully they weren't necessities in this world.\u000a\u000aA [[bed]] that seemed barely a step up from a cot was shoved into the far corner.  <<if $sleepy>>Despite the fact that it is the very minimum required for an object to be called a 'bed', it was possibly the most inviting space I'd seen all day.

Such a thing hasn't happened since the early days of our world, of course, and Athena stressed that - while she is still investigating - this is almost certainly an isolated incident.  Iva Koloman, 34, was found yesterday morning in her apartment by her fianc.  The unresponsive state of her body and the system's inability to contact her lead many to speculate that she had died.  Moments ago, Athena confirmed this was the case."\u000a\u000aGreat, I'd died just in time for mortality to come to the afterlife.\u000a<<else>>\u000a/%%/\u000aThe news was continuing its coverage of the Koloman case, and little else.

Instead, each had been replaced with a guard.\u000a\u000a<<if not $nftElevator>><<set $nftElevator=1>>I found out why when I tried to get into the elevator - one of the more intimidating-looking of them stepped in front of me.\u000a\u000a"<<if $gender eq "Mr.">>Sir,<<else>>Miss,<<endif>> I'm going to have to ask you to step back.

VI considered myself a good judge of character.  The ability to tell who's lying and who thinks they're telling the truth was a cornerstone of my business.  So it confused the hell out of me when Koloman appeared genuinely confused.\u000a\u000a"I would not have done such a thing."  he said finally.  "I cannot speak with authority on what happened to you during our call, and I do not wish to call your judgement into question - that would bode ill for the both of us - but many who are recent uploads into our world suffer adjustment symptoms.  It may have been that."\u000a\u000aWhen that answer didn't appear to satisfy me (because it didn't), he continued solemnly.  "I swear to you, <<print $gender>> Hallivert, I did not lock you in your room.  I want to hire a detective who is willing to take the case - more, who demands that justice be done.  If you are not that person, I'll not make you agree."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_koloman]]\u000a

VNickolai nodded at the question.  "A reasonable thing to ask.  There must be, you are thinking, many other detectives with more experience, and more knowledge of how the system functions."\u000a\u000aI'd more been wondering which of my specific virtues he'd thought of when he called me.\u000a\u000aKoloman continued talking.  "This is true.  You are inexperienced in this world and, compared to some of those here who have been investigators for over a century total, inexperienced at the job.  It is precisely for these reasons that I wish to hire you."\u000a\u000aThis was not a very good pep speech.\u000a\u000a"I am not sure if you have noticed, but police presense in New Detroit is... nil, to put it nicely.  There are men who used to be police in their former lives, but most of them have retired.  There is no need to police when the simulation can do so automatically, with far greater coverage and effectiveness.  Hmph.\u000a\u000a"What I am saying is that any overly-visible response such as hiring an expensive investigator would bring these men out of their retirement.  They have even less experience than you, but wield considerable clout.  They would make a show out of the investigation - moreso than it already is - and, I suspect, be ineffective at the actual investigating. \u000a\u000a"You, on the other hand, can ask questions in nearly complete freedom.  You are new to the system, it is expected that you will not understand it and will need to ask questions.  You have been assured of your immortality and yet seen someone stripped of that very guarantee.  Every act of investigation will be expected of you naturally."\u000a\u000aI frowned.  "So does this mean I won't officially be on the case?"  I'd already seen what dropping Koloman's name could do in terms of getting people to co-operate; it was a powerful weapon I'd rather not be without.\u000a\u000a"You will very much be on this case, <<print $gender>> Hallivert."  Koloman answered stonily.  "It will appear to the officials and gossips of this town that I am not taking my daughter's death seriously with your hire, and I am prepared to endure such accusations because I believe you will find me answers."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_koloman]]\u000a

"I swear upon this beer, I was a neurobiologist in life."  I was't sure whether his drinking the object of his vow invalidated it, but it didn't seem to stop him.\u000a\u000a"But you're a tour guide."  I stated.  I began considering the idea that Samahd was actually independently wealthy and just showing newbies around as a form of slumming.\u000a\u000a"I don't know if you follow the trade," Samahd replied in a tone that indicated he knew exactly how much I followed his trade, "but neurobiology is on the outs."\u000a\u000aHe started counting off reasons on his fingers.  "One:  The biology part.  The only part of biology you need is the part that makes the sensors for the brain-upload machines.\u000a\u000a"Two:  The 'neuro' part.  All of that is done by computers pretty much exactly like the one you're currently in.  If you want to do research, you just get consent from someone who's already been uploaded and watch their brain do their thing.  You barely have to know anything about neurons or how they're connected because the machines take care of that.\u000a\u000a"Three:  You can't do it from inside the machine.  At least not here in New Olympus; got outlawed sometime back, probably because someone wrecked someone else's brain or something.\u000a\u000a"Four:  There's no money in it.  Once the technology got good enough to do a full simulation, why bother doing anything else?  You've got your AI researchers making better machine intelligences, but that kinda rules out biology by definition."\u000a\u000aSamahd's omnipresent smile had actually dampened somewhat at this point, and he seemed to take a moment to put it back into place.  "Sorry if I sound cynical.  The ghosts of factory workers everywhere are laughing at me for being replaced by a machine, especially now that I am one.  I can't be too angry - the field used to be decently paying if not lucrative, and I could afford a few decades of afterlife, so it's not too bad."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_ferro]]\u000a

If he's sponsoring you a free trip to New Providence?  Go just to experience it.  New Detroit will never seem the same.  But accept the job?  I wouldn't be so fast.  If someone rich as the king of bankers wants something from you and is willing to pay accordingly, it's going to be damn near impossible to actually do.

VSamahd looks dumbfounded.  "What, you'd been locked //in//?  So far as I know, that's impossible.  Well, it's impossible to get stuck either way when it comes to your own property.  Only person who could do that is Athena herself, and I doubt her holiness bothers slumming it on this level just to pull a few pranks."\u000a\u000a"It happened."  I replied tersely.  I was getting a little tired of people not believing something I'd rather vividly lived through.\u000a\u000aSamahd just shrugged.  "I've got an answer you're not going to like:  noob fever."\u000a\u000a"What," I enunciated, "the hell," I added for emphasis, "is noob fever?"\u000a\u000aMy tour guide looked like he was debating between cracking up at this question and sparing me some dignity.  Fortunately for both of us, he chose the second option.\u000a\u000a"Kinda a slang term, in case you hadn't figured it out.  And like I said, you're not going to like it.  But not everyone who uploads uploads... whole.  Used to happen a lot more often, when the system was new and parts were still experimental.  Still happens from time to time, though.  There are patterns in the brain that take a while to adapt to a simulated experience.  Like you've probably slept since you got here, right?  You don't need sleep, but it's so hardwired into your brain that it'll take you a few months to realize it."\u000a\u000a"So sleeping makes you crazy?"  It was the most reasonable of the various ridiculous ideas floating through my head.\u000a\u000a"Not what I'm saying, it was just an example of something that holds over from life.  Some folks, they still get hungry or thirsty for awhile.  But in some cases, it's worse.  Schizophrenia sets in for some folks.  Psychosis, agoraphobia, mania - depression too, but that's pretty treatable."\u000a\u000a"So I'm crazy."

VGuillory's sole reaction was a slight raising of one of his eyebrows.  "That is a very influential person who contacted you."\u000a\u000a"So can I trust him?"  It was the most important question.  Of course, if Koloman was as important as Guillory had just said, it was possible I couldn't trust anyone's answer to that question.\u000a\u000a"He strikes me as a mostly reputable businessman" was the eventual answer.  "I only have access to public records, of course, but he doesn't seem to be particularly cutthroat.  His manufacturing concerns are simply more efficient than his competitors, likely due to proprietary techniques.  Koloman Industries applied for 1500 patents last year alone."\u000a\u000a"Thanks."  I replied.  It was probably the most I was going to get from someone who was himself answerable to a corporation.\u000a\u000a"<<print $gender>> Hallivert," he cut in before I could end the conversation, "a word of caution:  Men like Koloman are not used to disappointment."\u000a\u000a"Thanks."

The impossible is mundane.\u000a\u000a"Hackers now have the reputation of being a fairy tale, but I'm mentioning them for a reason.  A few months ago, my daughter got involved with their kind.

His tone indicated he hadn't gotten a particularly compelling explanation himself.\u000a\u000a"She was an artist, fascinated by the medium that is the simulation.  I don't mean that she was fascinated by working within the simulation, I mean that she found the simulation //itself// to be a medium.\u000a\u000a"She was not the first to think so, of course, the idea of reality as a canvas pre-dates realities as mutable as this one.  And the restrictions placed on this simulation at all levels mean it is much less mutable than one would hope.  Still, she worked to express this idea through the more mundane mediums.\u000a\u000a"Why New Detroit?  She believed it to be somehow more authentic.  New Providence is the most detailed of the simulated realities, but Iva did not find it to be //real//.

If there was a way out of the afterlife's simulated purgatory, I didn't want to appear too eager to learn about it and scare the guy off.\u000a\u000a"Ordinarily, yes.  These circumstances were different - the contract I'd written up for our placement into the simulation, it covered both of us, but only //both// of us.  We had to arrive at the same time."\u000a\u000aA slow frown came over his face.  "I anticipated that I would die first.  I did not want to spend an eternity waiting in a simulated world for my daughter to join me.  It seemed... unseemly to silently hope for her death so that she might live with me again."  He scoffed.  "So the contract stated that the first to die would be placed in storage."\u000a\u000a"And it was her."  I tried to say this as neutrally as I possibly could.  In truth, I was reeling from the fact that he'd not only lost his daughter recently, he was losing her for the second time.\u000a\u000a"It was."  He replied quietly.  He'd slipped into the somber mood I'd noticed whenever we got on the topic of how his daughter had been in life.  "Undiscovered heart valve problem.  I spent fifteen years in the outside world, waiting for my time to come so that I might join her."\u000a\u000aHe sighed, then looked back up at me.  "When I did, when I came here, the first face I saw was hers.  She told me about her dreams in Storage, how she'd seen the simulation for what it truly was, and it was beautiful and horrible, awful in the old sense of the term, like a fire that could consume a city."\u000a\u000a"I thought Storage was just... storage."  Once again, my newness to the situation was showing.  "You're shipped to some tape backup under a mountain or something."\u000a\u000a"It is."  Koloman confirmed.  "Not exactly as you described, but near enough.  You cannot dream in storage, because there is no 'you' to dream!  These were earlier days of the simulation.  I worried that my Iva had been one of those afflicted by the upload.  But aside from her newfound passion for art, there were no signs."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_koloman]]\u000a
