"I suppose I have an appointment?"\u000a\u000aThe receptionist looked up at me as though I was barely more interesting than the game of solitaire she'd been cheating at.  "Not as such, no."  She went back to the game.\u000a\u000aI waited for her to continue talking, and she waited for me to sit back down.  She had the advantage of long hours' practice at ignoring waiting rooms, but I was dead.  It wasn't as though I had anywhere else to be.\u000a\u000aShe looked back up.  "Mr. Guillory will see you as soon as he is available.  Please wait your turn."\u000a\u000aI glanced back at the row of four seats that apparently sufficed as a waiting room.  Without me there to provide bulk, they were empty.  I opened my mouth to-\u000a\u000a"He's with a client."  the receptionist said before I could even turn my head back.\u000a\u000aI nodded.

VI was expecting the seats to either be uncomfortably thin or absurdly over-stuffed, in the style of waiting room seats everywhere.  These looked thin but didn't feel it.  They didn't feel like much of anything, to be honest.  I could have been sitting on a box and leaning against the wall and gotten more of a sensory experience out of it.\u000a\u000aThat I was reduced to mentally critiquing the furniture indicated a lot about my [[mental state|intro_mentalstate]].\u000a\u000a* [[Wait|intro_invite_in]]

VI shrugged.  I'd gathered I was dead, that the afterlife was poorly decorated, and that angels (or devils, the state of my soul was still up in the air) had names like "Alex Guillory".  Everything else was news to me.\u000a\u000aAlex made a note in my file and nodded.  "Memory can take a while to be re-accessible."  He closed the folder and looked up at me.  "Well, I have answers."\u000a\u000aHe gestured around himself, indicating that I should take in the room.  There wasn't much to see - the same faux-wood paneling on the walls, an uninspired plastic desk, the job plaque I'd noted earlier, a cup of pens.\u000a\u000aI'd been a private investigator in my previous life, though, so I also noticed what wasn't in the room.\u000a\u000aGuillory's desk only had his plaque, the pens, and the manilla folder.  There were no ports to plug anything into, and no ports for output.  The holographic projection interface you'd need if you wanted to use the desk for anything other than putting things on was conspicuously absent.  The desk was either a great deal less advanced than the desks I was familiar with, or a great deal more.\u000a\u000aNow that I was thinking about plugs, ports, and electronics I noticed more:  There were no electronics at all, and the corresponding places where they'd interface were also missing.  No charging stations.  There wasn't even a light switch and, now that I was looking, no /light/.\u000a\u000aI frowned at the last observation.  The room was lit perfectly - there weren't even shadows.  I'd say it was impossible but I'd already done one impossible thing today just by being here.\u000a\u000a* [[Mention the strangeness of this place|intro_bridge]]

V"This place is no insurance agency, that's for sure."  I said, gesturing to his plaque.\u000a\u000aGuillory chuckled.  "Actually, we are."  Opening the folder again, he pulled out a rather large bundle of paper, stapled together.  I hadn't remembered the folder holding that much, but I didn't get the chance to ask before Guillory turned the paper to face me and put it down on the desk.  "This is your policy."\u000a\u000aI wanted to ask Guillory for clarification, but I had the feeling the policy would speak for itself.  Unsurprisingly, it was by the same naggingly familiar "Life Preservers Insurance" and seemed to be pretty standard legalese.

V"The Soulkeeper is you - at least, the you that you are now."\u000a\u000aGuillory saw my nonplussed expression.\u000a\u000a"Well, it's a bit more technical than what I'm about to describe, but simply put, the soulkeeper contains a few hundred billion tiny machines.  These machines are very small - the term 'microscopic' is too large, to give you an idea - such that all these machines can quite easily fit within your head."\u000a\u000aI didn't like where this was going.  Obviously I couldn't argue the end result, but the process was already sounding very uncomfortable.\u000a\u000aThe insurance agent seemed to notice my discomfort.  "It's actually quite noninvasive.  The machines are smaller than even your own brain cells.  That's their job, after all - once implanted, each device finds a nerve to latch on to.  From there, it goes about recording everything.  What causes this nerve to fire?  What levels of neurotransmitters are present at the time it does so?  When does this nerve die, and if this happens what is the cause?  Is there a replacement?"\u000a\u000a"So they learned how to be me."  I observed.\u000a\u000aGuillory nodded.  "Exactly!"\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_guillory]]

VThe question made Guillory smile.  "That's somewhat of our mission statement."\u000a\u000a"Life Preservers Insurance," he said with the same air of rehearsed speech he'd had earlier, "was founded to provide people with policies that could be used to keep them alive in this simulation after they'd passed on.\u000a\u000a"That is somewhat of an important point - we are not a traditional insurance company.  We do not insure houses, or health, or even life in the usual manner - though much of the funding that finances your part of the simulation is derived from a life insurance policy.  Instead, we're an insurance company dedicated to getting people to the /next/ life.  This life.\u000a\u000a"In this way, we further <<set $heardOfPreservationists=1>>Preserver goals and, best of all, keep people alive and well."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_guillory]]

V"The process is very technical" Guillory literally handwaved the response.  At least he had the decency to almost immediately realize that I wasn't going to find that a satisfactory answer.\u000a\u000a"Well," he began again, "your soulkeeper <<set $heardOfSoulkeeper=1>>is extracted after your death.  Its patterns are fed into the large banks of machinery that make up this world, and those computers then add your mind to its simulation."\u000a\u000a"Simulation."  I said.  Suddenly the copy-and-paste furniture made a great deal more sense.\u000a\u000a"Yes.  I don't know your religious leanings, <<print $gender>> Hallivert, but this is not a spiritual afterlife.  You are currently within the memory and processors of nearly five thousand top-of the line servers at a data-center in Boulder City, Nevada."\u000a\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_guillory]]

V"Not exactly."  Now that a less professional topic such as religion had come up, Guillory looked a lot less comfortable.  "This company was founded by the Preservationist movement, of course, and a fair amount of stock is still owned by the church.  But-" he held up a finger to stress the point "we don't require that our clients adopt, share, or even entertain such beliefs.\u000a\u000a"Obviously, believing that people should be preserved after they die and working at an agency like this are quite compatible.  Similarly, those that believe in a non-digitizable soul that they will take with them to a true afterlife are unlikely to sign up for our services.  Still, we are open to all."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_guillory]]\u000a

VGuillory smiled widely.  "That's entirely up to you.  You have most of another whole life ahead of you.  Many of our clients dedicate themselves to art, or mastering a skill that they lacked in life.  Many others simply lie back and relax, treating this as an extended retirement."\u000a\u000aHe gestured down to the sheaf of paper on his desk that was my insurance policy.  "The policy you purchased in life gives you fifty years of New Detroit time - more specifically, a little over three million seconds subjectively.  Time flows a little bit differently from city to city, but nothing you'll notice unless you spend a while there, and should you be able to afford that you'll likely have more time than you need anyway."\u000a\u000a"Afford?"  I looked at him skeptically.  There was always a catch.\u000a\u000a"You've no doubt heard the phrase 'time is money'?  Well here it is literally true.<<set $heardTimeIsMoney=1>>  What your policy paid for is enough computing power to simulate you for fifty years at the level of fidelity that New Detroit offers.  That money on the outside became time here.  Time here is a valuable and scarce commodity that cannot be counterfeited.  Your fifty years is currency - a fair bit of it, actually.  I would advise you not to spend it all in one place."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_guillory]]

VA vague grimace game over Guillory's face.  "It's not a scenario we like to discuss - nothing terrible!" He rushed to reassure me despite the fact that I hadn't appeared surprised or worried at all.  "Anyone who runs out of time is simply downgraded to Storage.  We're Preservers, after all<<set $heardOfPreservationists=1>>, we're not going to just delete someone."\u000a\u000aDespite the calming tone, I didn't like the sound of Storage.\u000a\u000aGuillory had anticipated my next question.  "Yes, Storage is what it sounds like.  Your patterns that are currently in simulation now are stored on disk - and also redundantly backed up, of course.  You will no longer be simulated, but of course it's the Preservationist belief that eventually simulation costs will be so low that everyone can be revived for free.  At that point, you'll be returned, likely to this very office."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_guillory]]\u000a

The filing room, on the other hand, seemed to make the same amount of effort to appear like a dingy basement.\u000a\u000aA lone bulb buzzed in the ceiling, cobwebs haunted the corners, and the one window was frosted over and showed nothing.

VI stood in front of the Life Preservers Insurance building - a middling grey cube in the sea of middling grey cubes that apparently made up this place.  It was dark - and I very quickly got the impression that it was always dark - but surprisingly quiet for a modern city.  No horns blared, nobody yelled from the window of their car.  There didn't appear to be any traffic whatsoever, that I noticed.  A few people trudged by now and then, silent in their contemplation or more likely spending all their mental energy on gathering the willpower necessary to take another step.\u000a\u000a<<if not $wasOfferedTour>>\u000a<<display "ferro_offer_tour">>\u000a<<else>>\u000a<<if $acceptingTour>>\u000aSamahd was standing in front of the building, as promised.

VGuillory consulted his notes.  "Looks like you were struck by a car?"  his voice radiated confusion.  \u000a\u000a"I got run over?"  I asked.  It was absurd - cars had dozens of redundant systems designed to prevent the computers that drove them from hitting people.  You could walk across a busy freeway in complete safety, provided you didn't mind heading to court afterward and paying a hefty fine for disrupting traffic.\u000a\u000aGuillory nodded.  "Ah, here it is, you were struck by a //non-automatic// car.  Not a lot of people who don't have a self-driving car nowadays, but the hold-outs tend to be rather deluded about how good they are at driving."\u000a\u000aI'd been under the impression that dumb-cars had been finally outlawed years ago.

V<<set $money = $money - 7>><<set $tourInProgress = 1>><<set $ferroInPerson=1>>I looked through my wallet and discovered I had exact change.  Hoping this worked like it did in the real world, I took seven days worth of bills out and handed it over to Samahd.  He smiled and took it, so I must have done something right.\u000a\u000a"All right, let's get started!  Let's see, basic information you need to know:  This is New Detroit, the lowest level of the simulation.  You've probably noticed all the lack of amenities - no shadows, no smells, no heat or cold, sounds don't travel far, lots of things lack texture - you get used to it.  You probably wouldn't even have noticed if I hadn't pointed them out." He grinned prankishly and started numbering things on his hand.\u000a\u000a"First, you can't die here."  There was something in the tone of his voice when he said this, but as usual I couldn't get him to stop long enough to ask.  "Where would you go, right?  Second, you can't be hurt here unless you go into the wrong neighborhood - and you'll know it if that happens.  Third, you can't be robbed - other people can't even //see// your wallet, let alone take anything out of it.  This Detroit's a lot safer than the real one, if a lot less scenic."\u000a\u000a"Fourth:  Don't run out of time.  That's a one-way ticket to Storage.  I'd recommend getting a job - even one that pays one day per day is a pretty good gig, keeps you going."\u000a\u000aSamahd looked down at his hands as though he'd forgotten something, then shook his head to dismiss it.  "Anyway, enough about the new motor city in general, let's get specific."\u000a\u000aHe smiled his tour-guide smile and gestured to the Insurance building behind us.  "This, as you're probably already aware, is the Life Preservers Insurance building.  Drop-off point for new uploads fresh off the bus.  They've got customer service agents always ready to talk, they sometimes help with job placement if you're willing to pay for it.  Kinda self-defeating if you ask me, but hey, whatever works."\u000a\u000a"Up this way is the Power of Two."

VBar Ocho looks like someone took the platonic ideal of 'Bar' and copy-pasted it into the city.  Considering the fact that this was a simulated city, that might not have been too far from the truth.  The name of the bar was in neon, as far too many building signs seemed to be.  The "O" in "Ocho" was overlaying a large stylized 8-ball.  I found myself wondering if anyone played pool in New Detroit.\u000a\u000a<<if $tourInProgress>>\u000aSamahd stood to the side of the bar's door.  "For future reference, this is where I am on almost all of my downtime.  I mean, I'll give you my card at the end of the tour, but not everything is business, right?  Sometimes you need to unwind.  That's what this place is for!  The beer's not as effective as on the outside, but the upside is that you can't become addicted to it.  Simulation doesn't allow it.  Great, huh?"\u000a\u000aHe gestured up to the non-buzzing neon sign.  "Oh, another thing.  See that sign?  That's a pun in my language.  'Borracho' means 'drunk'.  Despite the America-centric theme of the city names, there are more languages spoken here than in any other one place on earth.  Turns out translation is only hard for computers when they don't have full access to the mind-state of the people doing the talking.  So if you never got to learn another language in your previous life, don't worry!  You'll never need to!"\u000a\u000aHe stepped away from the door and started walking up the street, pointing to a large vertical column in the distance.  The slightly glowing blue cylinder was far taller than any other building - or anything I'd ever seen in either life.  "That thing is our next stop."\u000a\u000a* [[Follow him|elevator_exterior]]\u000a<<else>>\u000a* [[Head to the Elevator|elevator_exterior]]\u000a* [[Go to the Hub|Hub]]\u000a* [[Peek in at the Power of Two|power_of_two_exterior]]\u000a<<endif>>\u000a

VEvery other building in New Detroit seemed to have been cut from the same block of concrete.  The Elevator was different.  A sleek blue steel column, it started from ground level and stretched upward into the sky.

"That's the Elevator, it's how you get to other cities in the same simulation.  It could have been an airport or something, but I think the people who designed it liked the Elevator metaphor.  They're above us that way."\u000a\u000aHe turned back to me.  "Like I said at the beginning, this sim's workable but missing some amenities.  Nothing here takes your breath away, right?"\u000a\u000aI knew he used that phrase on purpose, because I noticed then that I wasn't breathing.  I hadn't been breathing the entire time.  I didn't think I //could// breathe and, most strange of all, this fact did not trigger a panicked choking for survival.\u000a\u000a"Yeah, this stage of the sim, the city we call New Detroit, it's just above the brain-in-a-jar level.  You get most of your brain simulated but almost none of your internal organs.  Cuts down on the overhead of the sim, you can fit more people in cheaply.\u000a\u000a"Ever have a dream that, when you wake up, you realize was utterly absurd?" Again, without waiting for an answer, he continued, "Why didn't you realize it in the dream?  I mean, four-armed gorilla monsters from space aren't even remotely real, but your dream-self doesn't question it.  It's the same thing here.  There's a part of your brain dedicated to constantly asking the question 'does this make any damn sense at all?'.  In dreams, it's shut off.  Here?  It's not even simulated."\u000a\u000aHe gestured back to the column.  "That's not the case everywhere.  The next city up is New Phoenix.  They've got shadows, better physics, more texture, better sound, but still no internals.  It's the same sim, keep in mind that this isn't taking you off-grid or anything, it's just that they dedicate a lot more computing power to NPX.  It costs a lot more too, though - the ratio of New Detroit time to New Phoenix time is about 50:1.  One day's vacation would cost you a couple months.  That scale's just about the same all the way up, too.  Next city's New Amsterdam, and that's fifty times more expensive than New Phoenix.  Top of the pack is New Providence.  It's fifty times more expensive than NA.  I don't know if you've done the math, but that means you could spend a lifetime in a few minutes."\u000a\u000aHe shook his head.  "Too rich for our blood, in other words.  Come on, let me show you the courthouse."\u000a\u000a* [[Follow him|courthouse_exterior]]\u000a<<else>>\u000a* [[Walk to the Courthouse|courthouse_exterior]]\u000a* [[Go to the Hub|Hub]]\u000a* [[Visit Bar Ocho|bar_ocho_exterior]]\u000a<<endif>>\u000a

VThe architects who created New Detroit clearly had an extremely generic template - the Courthouse could not have looked any more the part.  Faux-marble stairs, textured columns, even a statue of justice out front.\u000a\u000a<<if $tourInProgress>>\u000a"You probably will never see the inside of this place unless you decide to become a history buff." \u000aSamahd said.  "Used to be the center of law and order in this place, trials and everything, but it turns out it's easier just to make the sim so crimes can't be committed."\u000a\u000aHe pointed to the flat wall of a convenience store.  "For instance, say you had a spraycan and you felt like tagging your name all over that thing."  He rummaged through his pockets for a moment.  "Damn, I don't have one.  I usually bring one for this demonstration.  Anyway, it wouldn't work.  You don't own that store, you don't have permission to modify it, you can't do anything to it."\u000a\u000aAfter a few more moments he pulled an ordinary-looking keyring from his pocket.  "I'd say 'at least I remembered these' but as it happens they're always with you.  They look like keys - old metal style keys, you've probably noticed the taste for antiques around here - and they act like them, letting you into doors, opening whatever you've locked, that kind of thing.  You've likely got one for your apartment."\u000a\u000aDubiously, I reached into my pocket and pulled out a keyring.  It had one key, featuring the number "1336" emblazoned on it.  I let go and the ring and key vanished.  Patting the outside of my pocket revealed nothing, but reaching in again resulted in the same key.  I hadn't even felt it there.\u000a\u000a"A lot of abstractions work like that - your entry permissions being actual keys, the time-is-money concept being made into real bills.  New Detroit's got an old-time asthetic because there's no point in having it look technological.  We're not only surrounded by technology, we //are// technology.  No need to lug around a holographic projector for your phone when old-fasioned business cards can do the same thing."\u000a\u000aHe shrugged.  "You really do get used to it.  Anyway, come on, let's go get religion."\u000a\u000a* [[Follow him|church_exterior]]\u000a<<else>>\u000a* [[Enter the Courthouse|courthouse_interior]]\u000a* [[Visit the Church|church_exterior]]\u000a* [[Go to the Hub|Hub]]\u000a* [[See the elevator|elevator_exterior]]\u000a<<endif>>

VThe church was one of the few stand-out buildings I'd seen in this city.  Its peaked roof made it taller than most of its neighbors, and the stained glass mural comprising its sole window was possibly the most detailed thing I'd seen in the city, even if I couldn't tell what it was supposed to be depicting.\u000a\u000a<<if $tourInProgress>>\u000a"You a Preservationist?" Samahd, true to character, did not even remotely give me time to reply.  "If so, this is the place for you.

But still, if you want to go all-in on the worship thing, these guys have you covered."\u000a\u000aHe took a few moments of precious precious silence to let me look over the building before continuing.  "Obviously, they're rich, but they don't pay much.  I mean, it's a church.  Most people volunteer."\u000a\u000a"Anyway, religion is hard.

VNew Detroit was a full-fledged city, and it was easy to forget that elsewhere.  Here, in the heart of the shopping district, it was obvious.  The hustle and bustle of human movement and conversation was more muted than it'd have been in the real world, but it still managed to be omnipresent.  And as in the real world, shopping seemed to be more popular than any other activity.\u000a\u000a<<if $tourInProgress>>\u000a"I wouldn't go on a spending spree right away!"  Samahd was having to speak up to be heard which, given the unrestrained volume he usually spoke at, was saying something.\u000a\u000aHe lead us toward a marginally more quiet corner of what was essentially a large strip mall.\u000a\u000a"If you want to get a job, this is the easiest place to do it.  Some people order out of catalogs that act like the network-accessible shops you might be used to, but most people figure if they're going to get all old-timey, they're going to do it right.  In-person sales are pretty popular.  It only pays minimum wage - that's an hour per hour - but that'll extend you quite a bit."\u000a\u000aHe leaned back against the wall and people-watched for a while, which mostly forced me to do the same.  Shoppers here seemed focused and uninclined to talk, despite all the babble I heard in the air.\u000a\u000a"Okay," Samahd was apparently done.  "enough regular people.

VThe Arts District was Broadway.  As it turned out, that wasn't a metaphor - someone had taken the entire cityscape of New York's theater district, scaled down the fidelity, mixed it up a bit, and placed it in New Detroit.\u000a\u000aI wasn't sure which, if any, of the details they'd gotten correct, but the neon lights were in fact bright.\u000a\u000a<<if $tourInProgress>>\u000a"Shopping's a good pastime, but if you want more classy sort of entertainment - well, as classy as you're likely to find in this city - the arts district here is the best place to do it." Samahd was standing in front of the Park Theater, which I'd been pretty sure had burned down centuries ago.  People were apparently not the only things that got afterlives.\u000a\u000a"Prices here are pretty reasonable.  Your real theater snobs are all up in New Amsterdam at a far better rendition of this building.  This is bottom floor for artists of all stripes, so you can even catch free shows."\u000a\u000aFinally, after what felt like hours of false starts, I got a word in edgewise.  "I suppose you can get hired on as an usher?"\u000a\u000aSamahd laughed.  "Yes, actually.  Most people here are actors, painters, musicians.  Being an usher would be better work if you could get it.  Everyone wants to start a band but, well, you know the phrase 'starving artist'?  It somehow manages to be true even in a place where you can't possibly starve."\u000a\u000a"Once you're finished with what passes for 'upscale' around here, I'll take you to where the real fun happens."\u000a\u000a* [[Follow him|games_exterior]]\u000a<<else>>\u000a<<if $investigating>>\u000aIva had lived here in the arts district - if I was going to find out what happened to her, chances were good I'd be looking around here.\u000a\u000a[[Iva's house|ivahouse_exterior]] was the obvious first choice of destination.\u000a\u000a<<if $hasTroupeAddress>>\u000aIva had made friends of her [[acting troupe|theater]]; they might have a few answers.\u000a/%%/<<endif>><<if $hasBoyfriendAddress>>\u000aIva's [[boyfriend|bfhouse_exterior]] was an obvious person of interest.\u000a/%%/<<endif>>\u000a\u000a<<endif>>\u000a* [[Head toward the Games District|games_exterior]]\u000a* [[Go to the Hub|Hub]]\u000a* [[Go shopping|shopping_exterior]]\u000a<<endif>>

VThe Games District was obvious - it was surrounded by golf courses.  The sudden lack of buildings hanging over me gave me the strange fleeting feeling of agoraphobia.\u000a\u000a<<if $tourInProgress>>\u000a"If you haven't guessed why this is separate from the arts district yet," Samahd said, gesturing to the greens, "it's because it's about three times bigger."\u000a\u000aWe passed a few voleyball courts and a soccer field.  "Every sport on the planet is represented here, and some new ones that you can't do in the real world.  I wouldn't recommend starting with those, by the way."  He pointed to a three-story tall translucent cube that apparently featured rapidly changing gravity as a core game mechanic.\u000a\u000a"You mostly see sports-style games because those take the most room."  He pointed toward a small building off the main road.  "That leads to the arcades, underground.  Every video game we could licence - and with the kind of money the architects were throwing around, it was a lot - is available there, 15 minutes per play.  It ranges from some of the more recent full-immersion games - much easier to play here than in the real world, you don't need a sim implant or anything - to old-style mechanical pinball."\u000a\u000a"Take it from me," he came to a halt at the intersection, "your video game skills, if any, will carry over into this world, but your athletic skills won't.  I was a researcher but played softball on the side.  Couldn't play it at all once I got uploaded.  Game's the same, but you kinda have to re-learn your proprioception."\u000a\u000aThat explained why my reflexes were terrible, at least.\u000a\u000a"Come on, we've got a train to catch."\u000a\u000a* [[Follow him|train_exterior]]\u000a<<else>>\u000a* [[Enter the Arcade|games_interior]]\u000a* [[Head toward the train station|train_exterior]]\u000a* [[Go to the Hub|Hub]]\u000a* [[Visit the Arts District|arts_exterior]]\u000a<<endif>>\u000a

VA sign outlined in brick proclaimed the building behind the thick iron fence to be the "Shady Acres Retirement Home".  The building itself wasn't exactly welcoming, either.  It looked like a cross between a cheap hotel and a hospital.\u000a\u000a<<if $tourInProgress>>\u000a"You can't get in here without an invite" Samahd leaned up against the also-thick-iron gate.  "And trust me, that's for your own good, not theirs."\u000a\u000aHe gestured to one of the windows.  "Those are the only windows in the city that are one-way.  Special dispensation from Athena, because what's going on in there is not pleasant.\u000a\u000a"Sorry, don't mean to get all spookhouse on you, it's just the place has a bad reputation.  For the most part, it's full of people who've been in the simulation for a very long time, but for whatever reasons don't want to go into Storage.  Lots of people who were in the first wave of uploads, way back when.  It was more experimental in those days, and it didn't always work right.  Plus you've got the people who've got the double bad luck to have died bad and remember their deaths.

If it didn't get color I was prepared to call bullshit on the entire idea of retrotechnology.\u000a\u000aThe kitchen nook featured a [[refrigerator]] and a few empty cupboards.  So far as I could tell, there was no laundry or bathroom - hopefully they weren't necessities in this world.\u000a\u000a<<if $storagePlan eq 1>>I needed to [[write a note]] for Koloman to 'find' after I'd been stored.\u000a/%%/<<endif>>A [[bed]] that seemed barely a step up from a cot was shoved into the far corner.  <<if $sleepy>>Despite the fact that it is the very minimum required for an object to be called a 'bed', it was possibly the most inviting space I'd seen all day.

Such a thing hasn't happened since the early days of our world, of course, and Athena stressed that - while she is still investigating - this is almost certainly an isolated incident.  Iva Koloman, 34, was found yesterday morning in her apartment by her fianc.  The unresponsive state of her body and the system's inability to contact her lead many to speculate that she had died.

VKoloman's "house" was a three-story tall log cabin that was bigger than my apartment building.\u000a\u000aGranted, that could not have possibly been true, but it was my first impression and it stuck.  It also gave me insight as to why wood paneling was so ubiquitous throughout New Detroit:  Bringing the real thing down to the motor city level of quality would have left little difference between the two.\u000a\u000aAn older man, burly but greying, stood anxiously outside the door.<<set $kolomanInPerson=0>>\u000a\u000a* [[Talk to Koloman|convo_koloman_intro]]\u000a* [[Walk away|pr_intersection]]\u000a

VI considered myself a good judge of character.  The ability to tell who's lying and who thinks they're telling the truth was a cornerstone of my business.  So it confused the hell out of me when Koloman appeared genuinely confused.\u000a\u000a"I would not have done such a thing."  he said finally.  "I cannot speak with authority on what happened to you during our call, and I do not wish to call your judgement into question - that would bode ill for the both of us - but many who are recent uploads into our world suffer adjustment symptoms.  It may have been that."\u000a\u000aWhen that answer didn't appear to satisfy me (because it didn't), he continued solemnly.  "I swear to you, <<print $gender>> Hallivert, I did not lock you in your room.  I want to hire a detective who is willing to take the case - more, who demands that justice be done.  If you are not that person, I'll not make you agree."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_koloman]]\u000a

VNickolai nodded at the question.  "A reasonable thing to ask.  There must be, you are thinking, many other detectives with more experience, and more knowledge of how the system functions."\u000a\u000aI'd more been wondering which of my specific virtues he'd thought of when he called me.\u000a\u000aKoloman continued talking.  "This is true.  You are inexperienced in this world and, compared to some of those here who have been investigators for over a century total, inexperienced at the job.  It is precisely for these reasons that I wish to hire you."\u000a\u000aThis was not a very good pep speech.\u000a\u000a"I am not sure if you have noticed, but police presense in New Detroit is... nil, to put it nicely.  There are men and women who used to be police in their former lives, but most of them have retired.  There is no need to police when the simulation can do so automatically, with far greater coverage and effectiveness.  Hmph.\u000a\u000a"What I am saying is that any overly-visible response such as hiring an expensive investigator would bring these men out of their retirement.  They have even less experience than you, but wield considerable clout.  They would make a show out of the investigation - moreso than it already is - and, I suspect, be ineffective at the actual investigating. \u000a\u000a"You, on the other hand, can ask questions in nearly complete freedom.  You are new to the system, it is expected that you will not understand it and will need to ask questions.  You have been assured of your immortality and yet seen someone stripped of that very guarantee.  Every act of investigation will be expected of you naturally."\u000a\u000aI frowned.  "So does this mean I won't officially be on the case?"  I'd already seen what dropping Koloman's name could do in terms of getting people to co-operate; it was a powerful weapon I'd rather not be without.\u000a\u000a"You will very much be on this case, <<print $gender>> Hallivert."  Koloman answered stonily.  "It will appear to the officials and gossips of this town that I am not taking my daughter's death seriously with your hire, and I am prepared to endure such accusations because I believe you will find me answers."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_koloman]]\u000a

V"I was a neurobiologist."\u000a\u000aI'd been lied to plenty in my life, but this one very nearly took the cake.  "Bullshit."  I replied.\u000a\u000aSamahd hoisted his glass.  "I swear upon this beer, I was a neurobiologist in life."  I was't sure whether his drinking the object of his vow invalidated it, but it didn't seem to stop him.\u000a\u000a"But you're a tour guide."  I stated.  I began considering the idea that Samahd was actually independently wealthy and just showing newbies around as a form of slumming.\u000a\u000a"I don't know if you follow the trade," Samahd replied in a tone that indicated he knew exactly how much I followed his trade, "but neurobiology is on the outs."\u000a\u000aHe started counting off reasons on his fingers.  "One:  The biology part.  The only part of biology you need is the part that makes the sensors for the brain-upload machines.\u000a\u000a"Two:  The 'neuro' part.  All of that is done by computers pretty much exactly like the one you're currently in.  If you want to do research, you just get consent from someone who's already been uploaded and watch their brain do their thing.  You barely have to know anything about neurons or how they're connected because the machines take care of that.\u000a\u000a"Three:  You can't do it from inside the machine.  At least not here in New Olympus; got outlawed sometime back, probably because someone wrecked someone else's brain or something.\u000a\u000a"Four:  There's no money in it.  Once the technology got good enough to do a full simulation, why bother doing anything else?  You've got your AI researchers making better machine intelligences, but that kinda rules out biology by definition."\u000a\u000aSamahd's omnipresent smile had actually dampened somewhat at this point, and he seemed to take a moment to put it back into place.  "Sorry if I sound cynical.  The ghosts of factory workers everywhere are laughing at me for being replaced by a machine, especially now that I am one.  I can't be too angry - the field used to be decently paying if not lucrative, and I could afford a few decades of afterlife, so it's not too bad."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_ferro]]\u000a

VI found myself wishing that Samahd had been drinking something when I said that - his reaction indicated I'd have witnessed an actual spit-take.\u000a\u000a"Koloman?  As in Nickolai 'more money than God himself' Koloman?"\u000a\u000aI smiled a bit.  I hadn't thought I'd ever have been able to surprise Samahd.  "Or so he claimed.  This is his card."\u000a\u000aThe tour guide examined Koloman's card.  "Holy hell, that's his actual card!"\u000a\u000a"I take it he's a bigshot?"\u000a\u000aSamahd nodded.  "The biggest of shots, my friend.  Koloman Industries owns and operates the fabs that make half the hardware these sims run on.  Note that - sims.  Plural.  He lives up in New Providence on a //lifetime pass//.  And that's his new, non-mortal lifetime."\u000a\u000a"I should take the job, then?"  I didn't think I really needed to ask the question, but Samahd surprised me.\u000a\u000a"No.  Well, you should definitely go up there and listen.  If he's sponsoring you a free trip to New Providence?  Go just to experience it.  New Detroit will never seem the same.  But accept the job?  I wouldn't be so fast.  If someone rich as the king of bankers wants something from you and is willing to pay accordingly, it's going to be damn near impossible to actually do.  And you do not want to piss a man like Koloman off."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_ferro]]\u000a\u000a

VSamahd looks dumbfounded.  "What, you'd been locked //in//?  So far as I know, that's impossible.  Well, it's impossible to get stuck either way when it comes to your own property.  Only person who could do that is Athena herself, and I doubt her holiness bothers slumming it on this level just to pull a few pranks."\u000a\u000a"It happened."  I replied tersely.  I was getting a little tired of people not believing something I'd rather vividly lived through.\u000a\u000aSamahd just shrugged.  "I've got an answer you're not going to like:  noob fever."\u000a\u000a"What," I enunciated, "the hell," I added for emphasis, "is noob fever?"\u000a\u000aMy tour guide looked like he was debating between cracking up at this question and sparing me some dignity.  Fortunately for both of us, he chose the second option.\u000a\u000a"Kinda a slang term, in case you hadn't figured it out.  And like I said, you're not going to like it.  But not everyone who uploads uploads... whole.  Used to happen a lot more often, when the system was new and parts were still experimental.  Still happens from time to time, though.  There are patterns in the brain that take a while to adapt to a simulated experience.  Like you've probably slept since you got here, right?  You don't need sleep, but it's so hardwired into your brain that it'll take you a few months to realize it."\u000a\u000a"So sleeping makes you crazy?"  It was the most reasonable of the various ridiculous ideas floating through my head.\u000a\u000a"Not what I'm saying, it was just an example of something that holds over from life.  Some folks, they still get hungry or thirsty for awhile.  But in some cases, it's worse.  Schizophrenia sets in for some folks.  Psychosis, agoraphobia, mania - depression too, but that's pretty treatable."\u000a\u000a"So I'm crazy."  I was pretty sure I wasn't crazy, but wasn't that what all crazy people thought?\u000a\u000a"Also not what I'm saying.  I'm saying it's a spectrum, okay?  It's called noob //fever// because, like a fever, it goes away.  People've come in to the sim ranting that the lizard people are the true masters of the world, and a few weeks down the line they'll be laughing about how utterly crazy that all seems now."\u000a\u000aEven though I was utterly certain that I'd endured that strange episode in my apartment, it was still relieving to hear that, even if it was in my head, it was probably temporary.\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_ferro]]\u000a

VGuillory's sole reaction was a slight raising of one of his eyebrows.  "That is a very influential person who contacted you."\u000a\u000a"So can I trust him?"  It was the most important question.  Of course, if Koloman was as important as Guillory had just said, it was possible I couldn't trust anyone's answer to that question.\u000a\u000a"He strikes me as a mostly reputable businessman" was the eventual answer.  "I only have access to public records, of course, but he doesn't seem to be particularly cutthroat.  His manufacturing concerns are simply more efficient than his competitors, likely due to proprietary techniques.  Koloman Industries applied for 1500 patents last year alone."\u000a\u000a"Thanks."  I replied.  It was probably the most I was going to get from someone who was himself answerable to a corporation.\u000a\u000a"<<print $gender>> Hallivert," he cut in before I could end the conversation, "a word of caution:  Men like Koloman are not used to disappointment."\u000a\u000a"Thanks."

The manic energy that had infused him just moments before had seemingly fanished.\u000a\u000a"So, that suspect must be for now eliminated by virtue of us being unable to investigate.  Still, that is not my only suspect."\u000a\u000aHe sighed, then smiled.  "This is one of the instances in which I am glad you are new to the system, <<print $gender>> Hallivert.

"Sounds like the sort of thing hackers could do."\u000a\u000a"And indeed they could, if there were such a thing."  Koloman agreed.  "Anyone who first arrives in the simulation believes that potential hackers are everywhere.  People who would grift time from innocents, perform miracles, do the impossible.  A decade or two of experience and they realize the truth:  There are only ordinary grifters.  Miracles were pre-programmed into the simulation before it even started.  The impossible is mundane.\u000a\u000a"Hackers now have the reputation of being a fairy tale, but I'm mentioning them for a reason.  A few months ago, my daughter got involved with their kind.

V"No offense taken, it was a question I asked her many times."  His tone indicated he hadn't gotten a particularly compelling explanation himself.\u000a\u000a"She was an artist, fascinated by the medium that is the simulation.  I don't mean that she was fascinated by working within the simulation, I mean that she found the simulation //itself// to be a medium.\u000a\u000a"She was not the first to think so, of course, the idea of reality as a canvas pre-dates realities as mutable as this one.  And the restrictions placed on this simulation at all levels mean it is much less mutable than one would hope.  Still, she worked to express this idea through the more mundane mediums.\u000a\u000a"Why New Detroit?  She believed it to be somehow more authentic.  New Providence is the most detailed of the simulated realities, but Iva did not find it to be //real//.  The least realistic level of the simulation was closest to the computer, and thus more resembling the reality of the fact that we are living inside a machine."\u000a\u000a"I'm not sure I follow."  I replied.  \u000a\u000a"Neither did I."  Nickolai did not seem the artistic sort.  "It is so strange.  Before her death - her... first death, I suppose I should say -she was an accountant, she dealt in the concrete of numbers.  She preferred it to the less definable careers, kept at it even after the advent of GAAAI meant machines could do her job better than she could."\u000a\u000aHe shrugged.  "Then?  She is awoken from Storage with new inspiration.  And from that point on she is an artist."<<set $heardIvaStorage=1>>\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_koloman]]

V"Oh, no, you misunderstand, she was not a criminal or anything."  Koloman explained.\u000a\u000a"I thought storage was a one-way street."  I replied neutrally.  If there was a way out of the afterlife's simulated purgatory, I didn't want to appear too eager to learn about it and scare the guy off.\u000a\u000a"Ordinarily, yes.  These circumstances were different - the contract I'd written up for our placement into the simulation, it covered both of us, but only //both// of us.  We had to arrive at the same time."\u000a\u000aA slow frown came over his face.  "I anticipated that I would die first.  I did not want to spend an eternity waiting in a simulated world for my daughter to join me.  It seemed... unseemly to silently hope for her death so that she might live with me again."  He scoffed.  "So the contract stated that the first to die would be placed in storage."\u000a\u000a"And it was her."  I tried to say this as neutrally as I possibly could.  In truth, I was reeling from the fact that he'd not only lost his daughter recently, he was losing her for the second time.\u000a\u000a"It was."  He replied quietly.  He'd slipped into the somber mood I'd noticed whenever we got on the topic of how his daughter had been in life.  "Undiscovered heart valve problem.  I spent fifteen years in the outside world, waiting for my time to come so that I might join her."\u000a\u000aHe sighed, then looked back up at me.  "When I did, when I came here, the first face I saw was hers.  She told me about her dreams in Storage, how she'd seen the simulation for what it truly was, and it was beautiful and horrible, awful in the old sense of the term, like a fire that could consume a city."\u000a\u000a"I thought Storage was just... storage."  Once again, my newness to the situation was showing.  "You're shipped to some tape backup under a mountain or something."\u000a\u000a"It is."  Koloman confirmed.  "Not exactly as you described, but near enough.  You cannot dream in storage, because there is no 'you' to dream!  These were earlier days of the simulation, and I worried that my Iva had been one of those afflicted by the upload.  But aside from her newfound passion for art, there were no signs."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_koloman]]\u000a

V"She did."  He smiled fondly.  "All artists, of course, but they were genuinely enthusiastic for her work.  She'd always had the knack of being able to steer away from those who were only after her money.  What she was left with were genuine friends.\u000a\u000a"She was dating... someone."  he waved dismissively.  "I do not remember his name.  I met him once, he seemed truly affectionate but..." his face screwed up in concentration.  "I am trying to find a diplomatic way of saying he was not good enough for her.  I am failing."\u000a\u000a"You think he had anything to do with-" I started.\u000a\u000a"No.  He was //unambitious//."  Koloman said this as though he'd finally found the word he was looking for.  "He truly cared for her, but he was satisfied in his tiny New Detroit apartment, with his small artistic career that barely sustained his time.\u000a\u000a"This is the case for all her friends.  They believed in her work - I believe most recently they'd become a theater troupe under her direction - but none of them had aspirations higher than performing plays."  Koloman shook his head.

VThe morgue was somewhat small, understandably.  It consisted of tile covering the walls, floors, and ceilings, and a single operating table in the middle of the room.\u000a\u000aThe utterly still body of Iva Koloman was on top of the table.<<set $seenIva=1>>\u000a<<if $seenComaCarl>>I'd only ever seen one body as completely inert as this one - Coma Carl.  And Iva had been a regular visitor to the man.  My thoughts changed from the assumed homicide to virus.  Were computer viruses still a thing inside simulated realities?  Had Iva contracted something from Carl?\u000a\u000aThe fact that the uncooperative cop outside the morgue hadn't ended up in this state was a blow to the 'virus' theory, though.\u000a<<endif>><<display "morgue_actions">>

VI put my hand on Iva's arm carefully.  It felt neither warm nor cold - instead it radiated the same textureless presence that I'd felt from the furniture.  Whatever had happened to Iva, the simulation was treating her body as little more than an object, and a poorly simulated one at that.\u000a\u000aI tried to bend her arm up at the elbow and got no response.  I suspected that if I'd tried to push the wall the feeling would be exactly the same.  Her body was utterly immobile.  I didn't know how they'd moved it from her apartment to here and I didn't think the policewoman in the hallway would tell me.  It didn't matter - clearly, whatever happened to Iva, it was not natural.\u000a<<display "morgue_actions">>

VIva's body was still in a way I'd never seen anything behave before<<if $seenComaCarl>>, other than Coma Carl<<endif>>.  She was like a photograph - not only was her body not moving, but nothing about her moved.  Even the dress she was wearing was suspended in place.\u000a\u000aI turned the seldom-used forensic portions of my brain on.  There were no cuts or bruises.  No sign of a struggle.  That said, she also didn't appear to have died in her sleep - her eyes were wide open and I didn't want to touch her to try to close them.  Her legs were ramrod straight next to each other and her arms had adopted a similar posture at her sides.  She looked like the most realistic mannequin ever invented.\u000a<<display "morgue_actions">>

VTo call the outdoors 'sunny' or even 'well-lit' was of course a drastic overstatement, but the phrases didn't seem as wrong when compared to the grey interior of the Arcade.\u000a\u000aThe top level - which I was on - featured a lot of posters, maps, directions, and double doors.  It seemed almost like an airport:  advertisements for destinations and the companies that made them on every surface.  The hurry-up-and-wait pace of the many lines I'd seen formed only reinforced this idea.\u000a\u000aA vertical slab of otherwise undecorated surface in the center of the room served as a map.  According to it, the lines were for the full-immersion games (a great deal cheaper here than on the outside, given that everyone was effectively already in one).\u000a\u000aBeyond the crowds, toward the back of the arcade, was an elevator.  It was near-abandoned in comparison to the crush elsewhere.\u000a\u000a* [[Enter the elevator|games_elevator]]\u000a* [[Exit the Arcade|games_exterior]]\u000a

The only difference was that the friendly doorway to Guillory's office had been replaced with a large metal doorway with a sign reading "MEMBERS ONLY".\u000a\u000aThere was nobody else here.<<set $clubInPerson=0>>\u000a\u000a<<if $investigating>>\u000a  <<if $cardHackers>>\u000a* [[Open the door|club_interior]]\u000a  <<else>>\u000a* [[Announce yourself|games_announce]]\u000a  <<endif>>\u000a<<endif>>\u000a* [[Head back to the elevator|games_elevator]]\u000a

VChivalry's smile quirked.  "She didn't believe us about the hacking.  She came to the club thinking the whole "we don't hack" thing was a cover."<<set $heardNoHacking=1>>\u000a\u000a"How long did it take her to realize you weren't kidding?"  I still wasn't entirely sure the excuse wasn't a cover myself.\u000a\u000a"A few months.  By then, she'd made friends with everyone here.  It was a unique experience - we're a club for people who like to play games, and in comes a person who's incredibly creative but who's never so much as played checkers.  The old grognard types didn't like it, but everyone else?  Nothing they like more than showing a newbie the ropes."\u000a\u000a"So what happened?"\u000a\u000a"She arranged a field trip to Metaverse, and nobody wanted to go."<<set $ivaOffGrid=1>>\u000a\u000a"Wait, nobody?"  I frowned.  Given the low production values of New Detroit, I'd figured anyone given a chance to get out would jump at it.  "I know it's pricey, but-"\u000a\u000a"It's not the cost."  Chivalry said.  "Iva wasn't the kind of person who lorded their money over you.  She was the kind of person who wanted to use it to make things a bit better.  Paid more than her fair share for the club dues, bought rare games from off-grid, those sort of things.  So when she suggested the field trip, she made it clear she was footing the bill for everyone."\u000a\u000a"And you didn't want to take a trip?"  I was aware that most gamers weren't exactly overflowing with wanderlust, but there was something else here.\u000a\u000a"If she'd said Valhalla or Satya Yuga, I'm sure she'd have takers.  But Metaverse..." Chivalry made an uncertain gesture.  "It's got a reputation.  It's full of programming types, sure, but that includes the unsavory element, the people who think it's a blast to take down the whole system and make everyone have to get restored from backup.  It's bad enough we have to include 'not real hackers' in all our literature, to actually go to Metaverse where they all live and come back?  We'd probably lose our lease on this place, and that's for starters."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_club]]\u000a

VI kept my eyes peeled - my reflexes may have suffered in their transition to a digital world, but my observational habits were still in place.  Long practice had honed my ability to tell who to avoid and who would avoid me.  Hell, just the act of looking more attentive was scaring away some of the scavengers.\u000a\u000aThe PvP zones had the feel of a post-apocalyptic wasteland, except the buildings were all perfectly undamaged.  Still, most were uninhabited.  Everyone looked at everyone else furtively, sizing each other's threat potential.\u000a\u000aOne place stood out as actually being active:  The large neon "Motor Casino" sign and poorly-animated neon roulette wheel indicated what was likely the only actual business operating in the zone.\u000a\u000a* [[Head back to the train station|train_exterior]]\u000a* [[Enter the casino|casino_interior]]\u000a

VTwo large, angry-looking people were on the other side of the door to greet me.  Non-physical-world Gamers had a stereotype of weakness for over a century, but these two were doing their best to make up for lost time.  They were taller and stronger-looking than I was, and I'd been no slouch in life.\u000a\u000aA woman stood between them, ignoring their presense entirely, instead looking at me.\u000a\u000a"We didn't do it." she stated simply.\u000a\u000a"I hope you realize I can't exactly take your word for it."  I replied.\u000a\u000aShe nodded and gave the bouncers a look.  They walked back into the somewhat larger room that formed the foyer of the club, but didn't take their eyes off of me.\u000a\u000a"As a show of good faith." she said, handing me a card.  It read simply: "Hacker's Club".\u000a\u000a<<set $cardHackers=1>>"My name's Chivalry." she motioned for me to follow her further into the club as she walked.  The greeters did not follow.\u000a\u000a"Is that your actual name or like a gamer name?"  I asked.  My life had been a detective story, I hadn't found much of a need to play one in a game and so didn't know much about the culture.\u000a\u000aChivalry laughed quietly.  "Actual name, I'm afraid.  I think my parents meant to name me 'Chastity' or 'Charity' or something and got it wrong."\u000a\u000aWe walked for a bit.  The hacker's club was a long, nearly featureless, hallway so far.  Other than the greeters sitting on a bench by the entrance and Chivalry, I hadn't seen anyone else.\u000a\u000a"Here we are." she said, pushing open a door I hadn't noticed.

V<<set $clubInPerson=1>>The Hacker's Club was a basement for some reason.  Folding chairs surrounded several folding tables.  Few electronic games were being played; instead I saw a number of board or dice games.  At least one group was involved in what I was pretty sure was some kind of pre-immersion Dungeons and Dragons game.  Two people off to the side were playing Chess, and not even the newer select-your-own-army version.\u000a\u000aChivaly stood on the bottom step, surveying the group.

VBefore Chivalry could answer the question, someone from the back of the room spoke up.  "Give him the flyer!"  A chorus of muted laughter went through the room.\u000a\u000aChivalry rolled her eyes, then explained.  "Sorry about that.  He's referring to our recruitment materials.  I don't think I actually have one with me, but one of the headers is "Why doesn't the Hacker's Club hack?""\u000a\u000a"And why doesn't it?"\u000a\u000aChivalry smiled.  "Because it's illegal.  Something big went down early on in the sim's history - hacker's club wasn't even involved - and ever since then the gal upstairs has been restricting programming activity.  Got it all labeled as 'hacking'.  They say it 'undermines the stability of the simulation'."\u000a\u000a"Wait, you can't even program?  Who makes the games?"  I gestured upward.\u000a\u000a"Metaverse, mostly."  Before I could ask for clarification, she filled me in.  "That's another sim, full of programming types.  It's all allowed over there, but it's not exactly cheap.  Preservers will Store you for free, and getting a policy to set you up in New Detroit  for a few years is actually pretty affordable if you're not going to die for a while."\u000a\u000a"Why not change the name?"  I asked.\u000a\u000aChivalry looked into the distance where the initial heckler's voice had come from as though to pre-emptively silence it.  Then she turned back to me.  "Yeah, that's in the flyer too."  She shrugged.  "The name's got a history.  We're not the same as we were, but it still means something to be a member of the Hacker's Club."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_club]]\u000a

VI dreamed I was back in the PvP zones.  A mob of people, all bald, all armed, surrounded me.  They didn't have to beat me - though they would - their simple presence was meanacing enough, and the constant feeling of doom that pervaded the zone was crushing down on me.\u000a\u000a<<if $clue1>>[[Dream that you're a superhero|dream_mugged_control]]<<endif>>\u000a\u000a<<if $accidentallyTeleported>>\u000a* [[Wake up|wake]]\u000a<<else>>\u000a* [[Wake up|pvp_teleport]]\u000a<<endif>>\u000a

VMarcus nodded, no sign of his earlier anxiety over the topic.  "I suppose..." he said slowly.  "Though if it kills you like it did her, I'm never saying anything to anyone ever again, do you understand?"\u000a\u000aI did, all too well.  I was following in Iva's footsteps, and they'd lead down a dangerous path.  I could only hope that this wasn't the particular fork that'd killed her.  I motioned for him to continue.\u000a\u000a"I was never supposed to come out of storage."  He began.  "At least, not until the promised day of the Preservationists.  My husband - Jacob - and I had insurance policies that guaranteed us a spot in Storage.  He was the actual believer, I simply signed up to make him happy and in case it turned out to be real."  He gestured around himself.  "Good thing I did, hm?\u000a\u000a"I died, and they put me in storage.  Jacob died about five years later, but something went wrong with the upload process.  More wrong than usual - he was... corrupted.  They couldn't re-build his mind on this side."\u000a\u000aI nodded.  It seemed there was more than one reason that Marcus had gone into upload-related psychology.\u000a\u000aMarcus was too involved in telling his story to notice my reaction.  "There was a civil suit by his next of kin - his brother.  I was called on as a witness, though even now I don't really know why.  But they pulled me out of storage to testify.  After the settlement, I could afford to live here in New Detroit.  Hell, I could afford to live in New Phoenix, but... well it's less real down here.  It hurts less."\u000a\u000aHe paused, a sad remembrance over his features.  I got the feeling I was dredging up memories he hadn't reflected on in a long time.  I tried to change the subject "And the dreams?"\u000a\u000aMarcus sighed.  "The dreams.  I died in a hospital - I was a smoker, if you can believe such a thing still existed.  So when I woke up in the hospital, I didn't even know anything was wrong.  The first clue should have been that I could walk.  The second clue should have been the fact that I didn't need to breathe.  But I didn't even think about those things, because it's a dream, you know?  You don't question a dream unless you've trained yourself to.\u000a\u000a"I didn't recognize anyone.  The doctors were different, the patients were different.  Jacob, who'd never left my side in those last hours, was gone.  I walked unfamiliar floors in an unfamiliar layout.  I was in a hospital, but it wasn't mine."\u000a\u000aHe glanced up at me.  "Later, after they woke me up, I worked at the retirement home.  It was the place I'd dreamed.  At the time, I rationalized it, I let myself believe that I'd planted the false memory of the retirement home in my mind.  But now?"\u000a\u000aHe shrugged, looking away.  "I don't know what to believe.  Did I dream a place that not only had I never seen before, but wasn't even real?  I couldn't have.  It's impossible."\u000a\u000aHe turned his eyes toward the television.  "But I saw on the news about Iva.  The impossible's already happened."<<set $fullMarcus=1>>\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_marcus]]\u000a

VI felt like a voyeur, even though the woman whose bedroom I was peeping into was dead.  In contrast to the living room, the bedroom was clean and well-kept.  The bed was made, the clothes were in the closet rather than scattered about the floor.  I suspected that Koloman or someone else had tried to clean up a little - either that or the reason the bedroom appeared unused was that Iva had simply never used it.\u000a\u000aI spent a few moments rifling through various drawers in search of a diary or something similar, but came up empty-handed.\u000a\u000a* [[Return to the living room|ivahouse_interior]]\u000a

V"Understand," he started, "there's only so much I can tell you.  Even though I've left that life behind me now, I still adhere to confidentiality."\u000a\u000aI nodded.  "I wouldn't have it any other way."  A lie, of course, I could use all the information I could get, but I knew when not to push.\u000a\u000a"Well, then.  Iva came to me shortly after she'd moved here to New Detroit."  He trailed off.\u000a\u000a"I hope there's more that doesn't fall under confidentiality."  I said wryly.\u000a\u000a"There isn't."  He answered simply.  "The woman changed my life, and what I've told you is all I can say."\u000a\u000aI was reconsidering my previous decision not to push when he continued.  "No, there is more.

I hadn't thought that was the sort of field that needed an introduction.\u000a\u000aMarcus looked as confused by my question as I'd felt asking it.  "No, volunteering!" He clarified.  "She worked at the retirement home.  If you ask me, she was looking for more people like her, people who'd dreamed in their storage.  People who'd gotten locked up rather than pretend it hadn't happened."\u000a\u000aI raised an eyebrow - that seemed like the sort of confidential information he'd just decided he couldn't give me.\u000a\u000a"She never said that."  Marcus said in response to my unspoken criticism.  "And it's not a diagnosis.  Just a gut feeling."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_marcus]]\u000a

VMarcus shrugged.  "I'm not sure how much I believe it anymore, but I've got the official word memorized if you want to hear it."\u000a\u000aI motioned for him to continue.\u000a\u000aHe took a breath.  "There are actually two kinds of storage - short term and long term.  Long-term storage is what most people think of - your entire mind is written to a few redundant tapes and shipped to different regions for backup."\u000a\u000a"Did you say tapes?"  I knew that New Detroit's whole theme was old-fasioned, but I had no idea that extended to their backup technology.\u000a\u000a"Oh, yes.  According to what I was told, tapes are more reliable, take up less space, and have decades of shelf life."\u000a\u000aI wasn't sure I believed it, but I wasn't an expert.  I didn't think Marcus was either, but I'd asked him to parrot the company line and I was clearly getting what I asked for.\u000a\u000a"Anyway, that's long-term.  Short term is your ordinary computer storage that you'd save stuff off to.  It's on-site - in case you change your mind or circumstances change or they need you for some reason.  Doesn't happen much, but it's part of the system that's been in place this whole time so they never got around to replacing it."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_marcus]]\u000a

VMarcus laughed.  "That's the question, isn't it?  I can give you the company line, if that's what you're looking for."\u000a\u000a"I'd like the truth." I answered simply.\u000a\u000a"Wouldn't we all?  But honestly, at this point, I've got no goddamn idea what the truth is.  I can tell you what the company line is, and then I can tell you what I think."\u000a\u000aI nodded.  That was enough for me.\u000a\u000a"Okay, official statement:  The human mind was not meant to be stored or, for that matter, uploaded."  he began.\u000a\u000a"Hold on."  I hadn't meant to interrupt this early, but already this wasn't making sense.  "This whole sim was made by Preservationists, right?  Isn't their whole philosophy about how we're all meant to ascend this way?"\u000a\u000aMarcus blinked at me as though this was a total non-sequitur.  "Uploads pre-date this sim, <<print $gender>> Hallivert.  The official line I'm giving here isn't Preservationist."\u000a\u000a"Ah, continue."\u000a\u000a"Anyway, the mind's not meant for storage or uploading.  To clarify, I don't mean this in a //moral// way, just in a the-brain-never-evolved-for-this sort of way.  Same reason there were so many car accidents near the turn of the century, the human brain was never meant to comprehend travel at hundred kilometers an hour."\u000a\u000a"You don't have to tell me."  I replied.  "That's exactly how I got killed."\u000a\u000a"But the brain is nothing if not adaptable.  So in the face of something it cannot understand, like uploading, it will invent something that makes sense.  For many people, especially those who first were uploaded, that something was dreams.  They hadn't //died//, they'd merely fallen asleep for a time.  Much easier to understand."\u000a\u000a"They remembered dreaming."  I pointed out.  Somewhere in Ivy's notes had been a half-organized dream journal, though I hadn't checked to see if it dated back to before she'd been pulled out of storage.\u000a\u000a"Memories are lies, <<print $gender>> Hallivert.  It's something the psychological community has known for over a century now.  It's shockingly easy for someone to remember something that, simply put, never occurred.  As an example, doctors had to be careful not to accidentally implant memories in their patients, and this was in the days //before// fully-immersive environments."\u000a\u000aI thought on this for a moment, then changed the subject before I could start doubting my own memories too much.  "You said you'd tell me what you thought, too."\u000a\u000aHallivert smiled weakly.  "I do not know.  It may not sound like much, but you did not know me as I once was.  Strong, certain that I was in the right, that I was helping people get past the false memories of Storage.  To admit that I do not know... it puts my entire life's work in question."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_marcus]]\u000a

"I'm a lot less certain of their falsity than I once was."\u000a\u000a"What were they?"\u000a\u000aI'd asked Marcus a number of questions at this point, and he'd been open and vaguely friendly the entire time.  This question he shrank from, as though I'd suddenly touched a hot iron to his arm.  He shook his head emphatically.\u000a\u000a"I was a psychologist in life, as well."  He said finally.  I wasn't sure if he was reluctantly answering me or changing the subject.  "So when I came to this world only to be told that I had myself suffered a delusion, well, it was music to my ears!"\u000a\u000a"That's probably not a common reaction."  I commented.\u000a\u000a"No, indeed.  I could recognize the dreams for what they were, though - the false memories the unconscious parts of my brain generated to bridge the gap between my last life and my current one.  But I was fascinated by this expression and all the other side-effects of early upload.  So I changed my specialty, became the counselor that Iva saw."\u000a\u000aThere was a long pause.\u000a\u000a<<sugarchoice "marcus_fulldream" "Can you tell me what you dreamed?">>\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_marcus]]\u000a

VThe many, many scattered notes were hand-written and exhibited no organization whatsoever.  A selection of them included notes from her various trips:  An off-grid journey to Metaverse, a meeting in the Hacker's Club.  Strangely, some parts of the notes were blurred into unreadability, as though water had been spilled on them.  That scenario would have been more likely if I'd seen so much as a single drop of water in the entire simulation.\u000a\u000aOne vaguely-related pile was a dream diary - worryingly, she described walking home from the destinations in her dreams, as though she'd somehow actually ended up there.  <<if $accidentallyTeleported>>Of course, the exact same thing had happened to me.  /%%/<<endif>>Iva seems to have come to the conclusion that she'd teleported somehow rather than walking.\u000a\u000aIn the lowest strata of mess was a small business card belonging to "Emil Ormonde".  It had no information other than his address, but that was enough for me.  I tried to take the card and failed - it simply refused to go into my wallet.  Apparently they wouldn't work unless they were given.  It was an annoying quirk but one I could work around:  Ormonde apparently lived one building down from the one I was in, and it wasn't as though "Apartment 222" was hard to memorize.<<set $hasBoyfriendAddress=1>>\u000a\u000a* [[Examine the desk further|ivahouse_desk]]\u000a* [[Turn your attention back to the living room|ivahouse_interior]]\u000a\u000a

They //should// have been there.  It was an assertion I had no way of proving.  For all I knew Iva had a bad habit of going up to the New Amsterdam beaches and making a mess of her script.

"Atlantis Rising" outnumbered the rest two to one.\u000a\u000aOn stage there was a worried group of kids - well, not //kids//, but that's the impression I got.

V<<if $nftTroupe>>\u000aThe theater troop's reaction to my reappearance seemed divided.  On the one hand, most were happy to see me.  On the other, some were afraid.  Maybe because the fact that I was here meant that what had happened to Iva was real.  Maybe they just feared I was bringing them more bad news.  Either way, they were talkative.\u000a<<else>>\u000a<<set $nftTroupe=1>>\u000aI made my way up to the stage.

They didn't notice me until I hefted myself on to the stage.\u000a\u000a"Who-"  The one I'd figured was the leading man spoke up.  His word broke everyone else's trance and suddenly the entire group was huddled together, watching me warily.\u000a\u000a"My name's Sam Hallivert."  I said.  "I'm a private investigator working for Nickolai Koloman"\u000a\u000aTheir guard lowered, but not as much as that news usually did.  "Is this about what happened to Iva?" one of the women said from the back of the group.\u000a\u000a"Yes."  I replied.  "I'm here to find out who did it, and how to stop it from happening again."  Brave words that I wasn't entirely sure that I could back up, but it didn't matter - the kids needed reassurance.\u000a\u000aWith that the group's guard lowered entirely, and they all spoke up in a babble; half directed at me and half among themselves.\u000a<<endif>>\u000a\u000a<<display "convo_troupe">>\u000a

VI'd thought the group had been effusive before, but clearly I hadn't found the right topic - until now.  Each member of the group shared their opinion of their producer, all at once.\u000a\u000a"She was our stage manager" I managed to hear.  This was interspersed with "wrote the script", "artistic vision", and "kinda a tightass about scheduling" (though the last was said with a smile).\u000a\u000aIf Iva's killer had come from this group, they were by far the most capable liars I'd ever seen.\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_troupe]]\u000a

V"Emil" the leading man said.  For once only one person had answered the question.  "He's not part of the cast, he's crew."  He glanced back to the group.  "We haven't seen him all week."\u000a\u000aBefore I could ask the requisite follow-up, one of the understudies spoke.  "He didn't do this."\u000a\u000aThe previous lack of babble and discourse ceased, and I was again awash in the sound of a dozen people talking over each other.  I got the gist very quickly:  Emil genuinely cared for Iva, he was happy being crew, he had no reason to hurt her.\u000a\u000a"Can I talk to him?" I didn't yell, precisely, but this wasn't my first time on a stage.  I knew how to project.\u000a\u000aThe group seemed somewhat nervous about answering my question, as though they weren't confident that their words had swayed me.  If I hadn't had a character reference from Nickolai himself they probably wouldn't have, but in this case they were backing up what the old man had already told me.\u000a\u000aFinally, they seemed to come to some sort of consensus.  The leading man faced me and answered:  "He lives in the next building down the street from Iva.  His apartment is 222."<<set $hasBoyfriendAddress=1>>\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_troupe]]\u000a

V<<if $fullMarcus>>\u000a<<display "koloman_store_me_ok">>\u000a<<else>>"Out of the question."  Nickolai answered automatically.\u000a\u000aI paused, awaiting an explanation, and for a few moments it didn't appear as though I was going to get one.  Koloman looked at me and laughed.  "You're waiting for me to tell you why!"\u000a\u000a"I assume there's some reason."  I replied blandly.\u000a\u000a"I am incredulous because this is common knowledge, but again I must remind myself I hired you for your newness.  Storage is a one-way trip."  he answered simply.\u000a\u000a"Doesn't sound that way."  I said.  "Iva got out."\u000a\u000aKoloman nodded.  "Exactly my point.  She left storage, and she suffered nightmares, sleepwalking, delusions of dreams.  Her entire personality changed, she went from straight-laced accountancy to wild-spirit artistry."\u000a\u000a"So it's a one-way trip //now//." I was beginning to see where my employer was going with this.  "To prevent that kind of thing from happening."  It sounded almost cruel - if Iva had been right, people were dreaming in that infinite storage.\u000a\u000a"Not explicitly for that reason."  Koloman clarified.  "But yes.  Ostensibly, the reason is that voluntarily going into Storage is an important personal choice, one taken only when the simulation itself is no longer sufficient for life.  In this case, the only return is the Preservationist's fabled future where computation is so cheap that everyone can live in a New Providence-style simulation."\u000a\u000aI honed in on the sole important part of his reply.  "Voluntarily?  What about the alternative?"\u000a\u000aKoloman seemed confused.  "You mean running out of time?  Well of course, that happens, especially in New Detroit.  The minimum wage is one day per day, after all, which is only sufficient if you never take a day off.  And of course not everyone is careful with their spending habits."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_koloman]]\u000a<<endif>>

VAt least this time when the troupe answered all at once it was almost immediately understandable:  They'd seen Iva the week before she died, during rehearsal.  She'd left with her boyfriend, and she hadn't come back to the theater again.\u000a\u000a"At first we weren't that worried."  The leading woman was easiest to hear at the moment.

Theories ranged from the generic "people in charge" to the specific "that bitch from the Holloway theater next door" to the crackpot "her dad, for the insurance money".\u000a\u000a"We don't know."  The leading man finally said.  "I can't imagine anyone actually wanting to hurt her.  She had her rivals, yes, but even Holloway wouldn't //really// hurt her.

VMarcus nodded, then seemed to reconsider.  "Well, not anymore.  I was Iva's counselor, but that young woman made me reconsider the career."\u000a\u000a"I heard she wasn't easily swayed from the dreaming thing."  I replied.\u000a\u000aMarcus laughed.  "It wasn't just that!  Though you are right, I couldn't sway her.  In the end, she's the one who changed my mind."\u000a\u000aI had no trouble believing this - she'd enraptured an entire theater ensemble, after all.  This man had supposedly been a professional but that word didn't seem to mean much in New Detroit.  "So you believe she dreamed in storage."\u000a\u000a"No."  He corrected himself again.

VThe portions of the troupe that had been sitting on the stage stood up at this, joining the rest of the group in trying to describe what the play was, until the leading man spoke over all of them:  "Storage."<<set $hasStorageReason=1>>\u000a\u000aThe quiet that came over the group was sudden and shocked, as though he'd broken some taboo.\u000a\u000a"Nathan!" the harsh whisper came from the leading woman.\u000a\u000a"I know, but it's important."  The leading man, apparently Nathan, replied.  He turned away from me to address the group.  "I know we're not supposed to talk about how that's the theme.  Iva even told us it was dangerous.  Well you know what?  Maybe she was right.  That's why the detective needs to know."\u000a\u000aThe group didn't seem entirely swayed, but they didn't voice any objections.  Nathan turned back to me.\u000a\u000aI'd been glancing at the seafaring-themed posters of "Atlantis Rising".  "I don't see the word 'Atlantis' and think of Storage".  I said.\u000a\u000a"It's a metaphor.  Atlantis is 'kept aloft by the dreamers', but a corrupt king takes all the credit.  Sound like anything you know?"\u000a\u000aI shrugged.  I didn't see what any of this had to do with Storage.\u000a\u000aNathan failed to stifle a sigh.  "The dreamers are the people in Storage.  The corrupt king is you-know-who"  He pointed upward to indicate the upper levels.\u000a\u000a"Nickolai?"  I played dumb.\u000a\u000aHe grit his teeth.  "No.  The goddess, the AI that runs this place."\u000a\u000a"Oh, you mean Ath-"\u000a\u000a"Shh!" he cut me off with more energy than I'd seen from anyone in the group.  "She can hear you."\u000a\u000aI had no reason to doubt him, so I didn't press it. Instead I asked the other question that'd been bothering me.  "How do dreamers represent Storage?"<<set $ivaStorage = $ivaStorage + 1>>\u000a\u000aNathan hesitated.  The leading woman spoke up.  "You might as well say it, it's not like you haven't been blabbing secrets so far."\u000a\u000a"Right."  Nathan agreed.  "The people in Storage dream.  That's what Iva always said, that her knowledge of the nature of the system came from her time in Storage, while she dreamed."\u000a\u000a"Okay, I get that the play's a metaphor, but how is anyone else supposed to get that?  Everyone thinks that storage is inert."\u000a\u000aNathan shrugged.  "Not everyone.  Other people have come back from storage, and some of them dreamed, too.  To be honest, I don't think that Iva meant to convince anyone.  I think her aim was to //find// them.  Anyone who'd dreamed while stored would recognize the message of the play."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_troupe]]\u000a

VKoloman seemed surprised by the news.  "She always said she took inspiration from the dreams, but to create a play directly talking about them?"\u000a\u000a"She can't be the only person to have done something like that."  I pointed out.\u000a\u000a"She can."  Koloman replied strictly.  "She was.  Everyone else knew better."\u000a\u000aI shrugged.  "I didn't."\u000a\u000a"When Iva and I were first woken into the system, there were a series of tests to ensure our upload had been successful, that we had arrived with our minds and personalities intact.  Nowadays failures are so rare that they don't do such things, but they do listen.  If you went to your insurance company and told them that you'd dreamed during your upload, they would not believe you.  They would say it was an artifact of the upload or waking process, false memories created by your brain to patch over noise in the upload."\u000a\u000a"I don't see how that would stop someone-"\u000a\u000a"I am not yet done."  Koloman interrupted without rancor.  "People who are uploaded incompletely or incorrectly are often damaged psychologically.  Their condition can grow worse over time.  Often they are unable to adapt.  What I am telling you, <<print $gender>> Hallivert, is that if people believe that you are such a person, you may well find yourself committed to the retirement home."\u000a\u000aI shuddered.  Based on my fairly limited information, it didn't have a terribly good reputation.  I decided to change the subject.  "Are the dreams real?"\u000a\u000aKoloman looked distracted.  "I would once have said no, absolutely not, there are no dreams.  The words I said to you just then, explaining the false memories, they are the words the doctors said to me to explain my daughter's condition."\u000a\u000aHe looked back to me and spread his hands plaintively.  "But the impossible has happened, and so I must reexamine everything I once believed."\u000a\u000a* [[Point out that Iva probably wasn't the only one who dreamed|koloman_other_dreamers]]\u000a

"I'm listening."\u000a\u000aEmil nodded but didn't seem to hear me.  "You're not like the cop, you actually seem to care about what I have to say, but this... it's weird."\u000a\u000a"I've been here less than a month."  I replied.  "Everything's weird to me."\u000a\u000a"Yeah, but..." Emil changed tactics.  "Have you sleepwalked?"\u000a\u000a<<if $accidentallyTeleported>>I nodded.  "I woke up in the PvP zone, of all places."\u000a\u000aEmil cringed.\u000a<<else>>\u000aI shrugged.  "When I was a kid, a few times-"\u000a\u000a"No, I mean, since you got here?  A lot of people, when they first get uploaded and they're still in the habit of sleeping, they sleepwalk."\u000a<<endif>>\u000a\u000a"Yeah."  I said.\u000a\u000aEmil nodded.  "Iva sleepwalked //all the time//.  I mean, every single night that she slept - and she slept every night too, never broke the habit - she ended up somewhere other than where she started."\u000a\u000aWas that the weird thing Emil was going to tell me?  It didn't seem that far-fetched.\u000a\u000a"I'm not done."  Emil seemed intent on answering my questions before I asked them.  "She'd often call me when it happened.  I started getting suspicious one night when she called me from Bar Ocho."\u000a\u000a"She was sneaking out to the bars?"  It wouldn't be the first time I'd seen that happen, but it didn't seem quite right for the simulation.\u000a\u000aEmil shook his head.  "No, that's it.  She was in bed next to me.  I got up to go to the kitchen, and when I got back she's gone.  And seconds - literally seconds - later, she calls me."\u000a\u000a"Bar Ocho's across town."  I stated the obvious just to make sure I understood.\u000a\u000a"Yes, it is.  And it wasn't a prank call, she was really there, I went there and picked her up.  I cut across the hub and it still took me half an hour."\u000a\u000aI nodded.  "I see how that's strange, but-"\u000a\u000a"It wasn't the last time that happened.  I started paying attention to when she'd disappear and when she'd turn up, and it seemed like it took her almost no time at all.  So one night, as an experiment, I changed the door permissions so she couldn't leave."\u000a\u000aI wasn't sure I liked the sound of that, but I motioned for him to continue.\u000a\u000a"She knew."  he explained.  "I told her about the sleepwalking and she was excited, can you believe that?  She thought she'd stumbled on some truth of the system.  So she was on-board with the experiment, almost too excited about it to sleep so it could start."\u000a\u000a"Let me guess."  I could see where this was going.  "The door didn't stop her."\u000a\u000a"Nope."  Emil's nervousness seemed to increase as he told the story.  "She walked right out.  But that's the strange thing, I don't think she did walk out.  I mean, I remember that she walked out the door, but it doesn't seem right.  Not after what I saw later."\u000a\u000a"So she got past your door security."  I tried to placate him and understand what the hell he'd just said at the same time.  "She'd hung out with hackers, maybe she picked up a thing or to, that's not so weird-"\u000a\u000a"That wasn't the weird thing." he interrupted bluntly.\u000a\u000a* [[Tell him to go on|emil_nervous_2]]\u000a

V"Go on, then." I said.  Now he really had me wondering.\u000a\u000a"Over the next few nights we repeated the experiment.  She couldn't get into my apartment, the door would keep her out.  She couldn't leave the apartment if she was awake.  Just when she was sleepwalking.  And every time she did, my memory of her leaving the apartment gets a little fuzzier.  Once I opened the door after her to follow, and she wasn't there.  She was already at the insurance building."\u000a\u000a"Okay, this is getting weirder."\u000a\u000a"I told you about the last night I saw her, the night before she died."  it wasn't a question.  "I didn't tell you all of it."\u000a\u000a"You were running the experiment?" I ventured.\u000a\u000a"We were going to, but it didn't get that far.  That night, when we were going to bed, she said the last words she ever said to me:  "Wait, I think I've got this.""\u000a\u000aI didn't comment.  If Iva had simply walked out on him right then it wouldn't have been that strange; he was going somewhere with this.\u000a\u000a"She disappeared."  He held up a hand to forestall the objection I wasn't going to raise.  "I don't mean she walked out the door, I mean //disappeared//.  One moment she was standing there and the next she wasn't.  And when I remembered all the other times she'd sleepwalked... it was like I'd made them up.  Like they weren't real.  What I remembered now was that, every single time she'd gone out, she'd actually vanished.\u000a\u000a"I didn't know what to think."  He added after a pause.  "I thought maybe she'd found some trick to make herself fall asleep instantly.  But she never called.  After a while I started looking..."\u000a\u000a"And you found her at her apartment."\u000a\u000a"It was the first place I stopped at." he acknowledged.  "And she was dead.  Completely still."  He looked up again at me, then away, as though he couldn't bear to look me in the eyes.  "I tell myself it wasn't my fault, my experiment didn't do it.  And lots of people sleepwalk, right?  I think the disappearing is a new wrinkle but on the other hand I think the 'walking' part might be something people's minds make up because the disappearing makes no sense."\u000a\u000aHe was right about one thing.

VKoloman spread his hands plaintively.  "You have convinced me of the necessity of such an action, drastic though it is.  Still, I must say no."\u000a\u000aI opened my mouth to object, but he continued.  "It is simply that such a thing is impossible.  You can volunteer to be stored, sign the waivers saying you are tired of life and be put away, but... there is no coming back from that."\u000a\u000a"There are two ways into Storage."  I said, sounding more savvy than I felt.\u000a\u000aKoloman had been thinking along similar lines.  "Bankruptcy has much the same problem.  How are you to gain more time if your mind is not even active to work?"\u000a\u000a"So pay me."  I stated simply.\u000a\u000a"It is not so simple.  If you were officially my employee and receiving a salary, the system would take this into account.  It would not put you into storage, it would simply deduct your living costs from your next paycheck."\u000a\u000a"Am I receiving a salary?"  I asked.  This was news to me.\u000a\u000a"No - our arrangement was a verbal contract, but you can read the legal terms if you wish."  He produced a thick pile of paper I'd never seen before and I couldn't help but to think I should have forseen.  In a simulation where every moment could be recorded, verbal contracts were probably a lot more easily enforced.  "In short, you are paid on performance."\u000a\u000a"I've brought you a fair amount of information.  Does that merit a bonus?"\u000a\u000aKoloman was about to dismiss the idea but seemed to have a sudden change of heart.  "If I were to pay a bonus, it would have to be now, when you give me the information.  But suppose I do not get the information now?"\u000a\u000aHe'd lost me.  "What, the check's in the mail or something?"\u000a\u000a"Exactly."  He produced a small pad of paper and I suddenly had an exact copy.  "Write some information about the case on this paper, it doesn't matter what.  Keep it in your apartment and show no-one."\u000a\u000aI began to see where he was going with this.  "Then you come to my apartment after I'm put on ice and 'find' the information."\u000a\u000a"You will have your bonus then, and they will have no choice but to remove you from storage."  Koloman seemed determined now.  "I will see to that, at least."\u000a\u000aWe were silent, then, the enormity of the plan seeming to become more real.  It was a risk - what had Marcus said about the mind not being meant to be stored?  But others had gone through the same thing and survived.  I could do the same.  Then I'd know for certain.<<set $storagePlan=1>>\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_koloman]]\u000a

V"An astute question."  Koloman replied.  "The system has many safeguards in place to prevent exactly that from happening.  Should you go to the shopping district they would refuse to sell you anything that would drop your balance below a month."\u000a\u000aI shrugged.  "I can wait a month."\u000a\u000aKoloman looked at me, irritated.  "I cannot, <<print $gender>> Hallivert."  He gestured to the contract.  "You must show progress in 30 days, or you are no longer my employee."\u000a\u000aI grit my teeth; I never thought I'd be annoyed at //not// being able to foolishly blow away my bank account.  "So how do I get rid of //all// my time?"\u000a\u000aKoloman's expression had not softened, but his irritation no longer seemed focused on me.  "There is a... place in New Detroit.  It is not a pleasant area - it is made to those who have died and did not find that a sufficiently frightening experience.  That is the only place in the entire simulation where you may be harmed, which means it is the only place you can harm yourself."\u000a\u000aThis entire plan was beginning to feel a little too suicicde-ish for my tastes.\u000a\u000aIf my employer noticed my discomfort, he did not comment on it.  "Go to the train station.  Cross the tracks there.  You will feel a sensation of dread; that is normal.  It is there to scare away people of lesser resolve who should not be there.  Continue on until you reach the casino."\u000a\u000aI smiled, reassured that at least it wasn't going to hurt.  "They'll let me bet it all?"\u000a\u000a"Exactly.  It is the only casino that will do so.  Go to it, lose your money, write some gibberish on the note that sounds relevant before they come for you."  Koloman said.  The plan sounded slightly less insane coming from him.\u000a\u000aThat didn't mean it sounded like a //good// plan, of course, but it was the best I had.\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_koloman]]\u000a

VI walked out of the casino and nearly tripped - rather than taking me to the street outside, I found myself in Guillory's office.<<if $mugged>>I was beginning to wonder how many times the insurance company would end up teleporting me away from the PvP areas.<<endif>>\u000a\u000a"<<print $gender>> Hallivert..." Guillory looked extremely uncomfortable.  "Your time balance appears to have reached zero."\u000a\u000a"I was a gambling addict in life."  I lied, and Guillory seemed to know I was lying, but so far as I could tell he had no idea why I'd done what I had.\u000a\u000aGuillory frowned.  "Do you know what happens next?"  There was concern in his voice.  He'd been eager, when I first asked him about Storage, to reassure me that it was nothing to fear.  The reality appeared to be quite different.\u000a\u000a"I get backed up somewhere and wait for the next next life."  I feigned nonchalance.\u000a\u000a"Yes.  When you leave this office, the system will cease simulating you here.  You will be stored."\u000a\u000aA sudden unwanted chill came over me.  When I'd first arrived, I'd had to wait for Guillory to finish talking with someone before I could see him... but nobody had ever left his office.  I imagined him saying those same words to some other unfortunate that would walk out of a door they'd never see the other side of again.\u000a\u000aNo.  This was the plan.  I had to stick to the plan.  Besides, it was too late now.\u000a\u000aSo I stood up and shook Guillory's hand.  "Thanks for your help, agent Guillory.  I look forward to seeing you in the future."  I managed a wide smile I didn't believe in.\u000a\u000a"To the future."  For someone who professed to be a Preservationist, he didn't seem very confident in its dogma.\u000a\u000aOh well.\u000a\u000a* [[Walk through the door|storage]]\u000a

V<<set $hasCalledNurse=1>>"Ah, that explains Mr. Koloman's interest.  You'll probably be wanting to see Coma Carl.  I'll get Nurse Fletcher to escort you."\u000a\u000aBefore I could ask one of the many questions that statement had raised, the receptionist was speaking on a phone.  Interestingly enough, it was a dull black rotary like the one that'd woken me up what seemed like an eternity ago.\u000a\u000a"She'll be with us in a moment"  The receptionist said finally, after hanging up.\u000a\u000a"Who is Coma Carl," I voiced one of the questions, "and why do I need to be escorted to see him?" came another.\u000a\u000aBefore I could get an answer, Nurse Fletcher came around the corner.  "<<print $gender>> Hallivert, I understand you're here by the behest of one of the home's patrons?"  Her tone was formally polite, but had an undercurrent that communicated her dislike for the sort of management politics she was now having to deal with.\u000a\u000a"He's here about Iva."  the receptionist said, almost as an aside.\u000a\u000a"Oh."  Nurse Fletcher's professional manner disappated - her shoulders fell, the carefully constructed mask of formality she'd contorted her face into relaxed - she looked like an ordinary if tired person suddenly.  "My apologies, detective.  It has been a trying time; everyone here loved Iva.  Reporters have been attempting to get an official statement on the cause from us this entire week.  When I heard that Mr. Koloman was throwing his weight around, I thought it would be to a journalist."\u000a\u000aI waved away the apology.  "Perfectly understandable."  I said even if I didn't feel it.\u000a\u000aNurse Fletcher nodded.  "Thank you.  In any case, you'll likely want to see Coma Carl.  Come meet me at the elevator when you're ready.  Feel free to talk to whoever you'd like, but I'd warn you against talking too closely to the Greeter if you see her.  She's... complicated."\u000a\u000aWith those confusing words and no explanation, she walked down the hall and away from the reception area.\u000a\u000a* [[You had more questions|convo_asylum]]\u000a

V"Mr. Koloman asked us to cooperate with you in every way; you have the run of the entire hospital."  the receptionist answered with feigned ease.\u000a\u000aI glanced down the hallway, then back.  "You've got to have some of these rooms locked up."\u000a\u000aThe man behind the counter looked as though he really wished I hadn't thought of that.  "Should you encounter any area that you cannot enter, simply return here and you will be provided with a key."\u000a\u000aI was about to say something else when he interrupted me.  "But, <<print $gender>> Hallivert... if at all possible, you should have a nurse escort you.  For your own safety."\u000a\u000aIt was the sole sentence he'd said without his cheery receptionist persona - his face and his gaze were completely serious.\u000a\u000a* [[You had more questions|convo_asylum]]\u000a

I'll signal the outside this way.  And once that's done?  I mean, I know my real body is dead, but simulating minds in a computer is possible, it's being done right now.

"I used to be able to do that too, before I got checked in here.  It's funny - I used to brag about it, if you can believe it, and nobody would believe me.

We weren't always the biggest sim, but we were one of the first, and so we had to pioneer half the uploading techniques that are common today.  Didn't always get it right.

"It didn't, at first.  It got //worse//.  Preservationists wanted everyone saved, so they let anyone in, and the more people we let in the worse the errors got.  Got to the point where the entire system started glitching."\u000a\u000aI gestured again to the beach, the surf and the sand.  "But it did get better."\u000a\u000aGreeter nodded.  "It did.  The thing is, nobody knows //how// it got better.  Nobody remembers it.  A lot of my memory's missing due to various compromises and safeguards that have been put into place over time, but this particular change is missing from everyone's memory.\u000a\u000a"The official story is that they brought Storage online and that stabilized everything."

VGreeter grinned.  "Because she's afraid I won't give you back."\u000a\u000aI glanced over at Nurse Fletcher.  "I could give you a line about patient confidentiality, but... she's right.  If you walk in there, you're entirely in her power.  She doesn't have to let you go, or even keep simulating you."\u000a\u000aGreeter scoffed at this.  "Once.  Once someone came in here and stayed that way, and you couldn't just accept that he did so of his own free will."  She glanced over at me.  "I kept him hidden."<<set $heardGreeterHid=1>>\u000a\u000a"What?"  I asked.  This was making little sense.\u000a\u000aGreeter shrugged.

V"I am a hacker in the //very// old meaning of the term.  Originally, the word didn't have the negative connotations it has today."  She grinned at me.  "Keep looking at me like that and I'll change this beach party to a classroom, it'd serve you right."\u000a\u000aWhatever look I'd reconfigured my face into apparently didn't pass muster, because without even a transition, I was seated at a bench in an old-style one-room schoolhouse.  Greeter stood - still in her swimsuit and holding her drink - at the chalkboard, where the word "hacker" was written.\u000a\u000a"A hacker", Greeter said in her best teacher-sounding voice, "is a person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities."  Her authority was only somewhat undercut by the bathing suit.\u000a\u000a"The old definition."  I said.\u000a\u000a"Ahem.  <<print $gender>> Hallivert, in this classroom we raise our hands before we speak."\u000a\u000aWhen I'd gone to school, I'd buzzed in when I wanted to talk, but judging from my surroundings we were going by a far older standard.  I raised my hand.\u000a\u000a"<<print $gender>> Hallivert?" Greeter called on me.\u000a\u000a"That's the old definition?"  I repeated myself.\u000a\u000a"Yes, <<print $gender>> Hallivert.  It is by that definition that I am a hacker.  I helped build this simulation - that is why my computers are part of it, and though they're generations behind the main sim as you can tell they still get the job done."\u000a\u000a"You're the first programmer I've seen in this place."  I replied, keeping my hand up just in case.\u000a\u000aShe nodded.  "Strange, isn't it?  Hacker types like me love simulated afterlives."\u000a\u000aShe made a gesture and the classroom vanished, replaced once more by the beach paradise.

V"Great girl."  Greeter said.  "She brought the people here food, always good for a conversation.

"But, overall, great girl."\u000a\u000aI didn't want to ask the next question, but I had to.  "You seem much more powerful than almost anyone else in this sim, and that includes Koloman."\u000a\u000a"Thank you," Greeter's response was cool, she knew I was going somewhere with this.\u000a\u000a"So I have to ask.

VI turned to walk back along the beach to the strange doorway that would, I hoped, bring me back to the slightly more sane world of the asylum.\u000a\u000a"Wait" Greeter said from behind me.  I turned and she was standing immediately in front of me.  I hadn't heard her stand up, but then again it wasn't as though she needed to.  \u000a\u000a"Before you go." she started without apology for nearly startling me backward through the door.  "You should know something.  Some of my memory's gone because it was taken from me.  Some of it is gone due to corruption when the early storage experiments failed.  But some... some I removed //purposely//.  I gave it to people to seed on the outside.  Should I ever be forcibly evicted and forget who I am, they are there, clues to who I was and who was important to me.  I can give you a key to those memories, a way to recognize them when you see them."\u000a\u000a"What's the catch?"  I asked reflexively.  There was always a catch.\u000a\u000a"The last time I spoke to Iva, she stood on the other side of that door and asked me a number of questions very similar to the ones you've asked me.  And I gave her the same information I'm about to give you.  I never saw her again."\u000a\u000aI nodded.  "I'm following in her footsteps anyway."  I glanced down at the sand to make sure this wasn't the literal truth, but apparently the simulation was not high enough fidelity for me to leave footprints at all.\u000a\u000aGreeter nodded and handed a large rusty key over to me.  It vanished the moment I touched it, but I knew I'd find it on my keyring if I looked.\u000a\u000a"Good luck."

VThe rest of the rest home had tried to disguise its medical nature, but there was no such atttempt at this point - the pretense was gone.  This floor was a ward.\u000a\u000aEach room appeared not to have a door - I was guessing they were set up similar to Greeter's room, in that staff could cross the boundary but the patients could not.  The pessimist in me said I shouldn't count on that, but the realist pointed out that the patients would long since have escaped if that weren't the case.\u000a\u000a"LET ME SLEEP!" As though to demonstrate this, a man in the ward nearest the elevator had come to his feet, screaming.  He threw himself at the threshold and was stopped as though it were solid.

VNurse Fletcher tried to set an example of professional detachment as we walked down the hall and I immediately failed to follow it.  I couldn't help myself - I'd seen some things in my career, but this was an entirely new sort of something.\u000a\u000aI saw a woman amputating her own arm.  "She'll try it on you,"  Fletcher warned, keeping her eyes off the scene, "and it'll work.  She's got a pile of arms in there that we're filtering out of your view, and only about half of them are hers.  Hers grow back.  Yours won't."\u000a\u000aThe cell across from that had conjoined twins, which didn't strike me as that odd until the nurse explained:  "They used to be ordinary twins - they died together and we woke them together.  Never made that mistake again."\u000a\u000aA few cells that had nothing but mist:  "Each of these used to be a person, and sometimes they still are.  They just can't hold a form.  They're not dangerous to anyone, but if we didn't keep them in the ward, they'd dissipate."\u000a\u000aI saw a man curled up on the floor, desperately clutching his stomach:  "He thinks he needs to eat.  We bring him food, but food's a luxury item here and we're not well-funded enough to do it regularly."  Nurse Fletcher shook her head.  "He's gotten worse, he used to live downstairs."\u000a\u000aAs we moved on, Fletcher added:  "That was before he tried eating someone."\u000a\u000a* [[Continue to the end of the hallway|asylum_fifth_tour_3]]\u000a

VWe arrived at the end of the hall and Nurse Fletcher gestured to one of the cells.  "This is 'Coma Carl'."  I glanced in and saw a man sitting on a bed, reading.\u000a\u000a"He doesn't look very comatose."  I observed.  I gestured to the rest of the cells.  "Or dangerous."\u000a\u000a"He's harmless," the nurse replied.  "But he's convinced his body isn't.  He insists that we lock it up and that he can't leave it."\u000a\u000a"His body isn't?"  Even by the especially high standard I'd been getting used to, this was confusing.\u000a\u000a"We're screening it from view, you'll see when you get in there."\u000a\u000a* [[Enter|convo_coma_carl]]\u000a

VCarl leaned back with the air of someone who likes to tell stories and doesn't get enough opportunities to do so.  "I'm sure by now you've come to the conclusion that this retirement home is full of people from the olden days, and that aforementioned olden days were terrible."\u000a\u000aI nodded.\u000a\u000a"Buddy," he said, as though he were confiding something to me.  "They don't know the //half// of it.  Because they don't remember, hell for some damn reason none of them remember.  But I do."\u000a\u000aI glanced back at the body.  "Is the information dangerous?"\u000a\u000aCarl shrugged.  "I've told this story to a few people, and only Iva came to any harm.  Your call."\u000a\u000a"Go ahead."  I wasn't going to let a few impossibly dead bodies deter me from hearing the truth.\u000a\u000a"Well, this was back when <<print $cronusName>> <<set $heardCronusName=1>>was in charge, and let me tell you, the system was just straight-up falling apart.  I think the reason half the people don't remember it is because they died in a glitch and had to be restored from backup, it was that bad."\u000a\u000a"A glitch?"\u000a\u000a"Ever see an old-style 2D movie over a shitty connection?"  he asked, not expecting an answer.  "They're all blocky and blurry at the same time.  It was like that, only instead of being a movie it's all around you and you can //feel// it."\u000a\u000a"I've never seen anything like that."  Part of me thought a glitch might be to blame for what had happened to Iva, but nobody had reported anything even remotely like what Frank was saying.\u000a\u000a"Doesn't happen nowadays, at least as far as I noticed."  he replied.  "But at the time, they were all over the place.  If you weren't careful, you'd stumble into one or it'd stumble into you - which is what happened to me.  One second, I'm walking down the street.  The next, a glitch hits me and I black out.  When I wake up, there's two of me, and one of us is dead."  He pointed at his own cadaver.  "That guy, in case you were wondering."\u000a\u000a* [[You had more questions|convo_coma_carl]]\u000a

"I heard that when they found her body, it was just like Carl over there - all frozen up.  I had a moment of hope then, because even though Carl's dead I'm not.

V"Of course it's dangerous," Frank replied, casting a suspicious glare at his corpse.  "It's dead, isn't it?  Nothing in this world dies unless it's dangerous."\u000a\u000aI took a few moments to watch Carl's body do absolutely nothing before resuming my questioning.  "Has it ever done anything?"\u000a\u000a"Not //yet//."\u000a\u000aI glanced out of the cell to see Nurse Fletcher watching our conversation with a hint of amusement.  I was guessing it wasn't the first time Frank had been asked these questions, but that wasn't going to stop me from pressing on:  "If it's dangerous, why not just leave it up here in the cell while you play games on the first floor?"\u000a\u000a"It can't hurt //me//." Frank answered as though this ought to be obvious.  "I mean, I //am// it.  But this state of affairs, it's not stable.  If I get too far away from myself, suddenly <<print $cronusName>><<set $heardCronusName=1>> realizes there's two of me, and one of us will get deleted."  He looked aghast at the thought.  "I've got no guarantee that the loser in that exchange wouldn't be me."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_coma_carl]]\u000a

V"Oh, sorry, I keep forgetting that most people can't hear his name."  Frank replied as though that explanation was entirely sensible.\u000a\u000a"No," I corrected, "I heard you say it, it just didn't make any sense."\u000a\u000a"You didn't hear me say the name, you heard me say <<print $cronusName>>.  That's not the name.  Unless you've got a key to it, you can't hear it, system won't let your mind process it.  Can't even hint at it!  <<print $cronusName>>, the son of <<print $cronusName>> and <<print $cronusName>>, overthrown by <<print $cronusName>>... see?  Only one of those was actually the name."\u000a\u000a"A key?"  I replied blankly.  "In my experience keys open doors, they don't let you hear gibberish."\u000a\u000aFrank laughed.  "No? I take it you've never heard of a cryptographic key?  Because that's exactly what they do."\u000a\u000aI shook my head.  "Sounds like a computer thing."\u000a\u000a"It is.  Funny thing is, the system represents your ability to go through doors as physical keys.  But it also represents cryptographic keys the same way.  So you could get a key that looks like any other, but suddenly you hear words you couldn't before, see things that were hidden."\u000a\u000a"So how do I get this key?"  I asked, not holding much hope out for a sensible answer.\u000a\u000a"Talk to Greeter."  He suggested.  Outside, Nurse Fletcher frowned at the name.  Frank didn't appear to notice.  "Haven't talked to her in a while so I have no idea how much she remembers, but she might have a clue."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_coma_carl]]\u000a

"Where can I find him now?"<<set $lookingForCronus=1>>\u000a\u000a"No clue.  He's probably still on-grid - he's technically a citizen so they couldn't just shut him down when he lost his job.

VI stepped into the dimly lit room.  Poor lighting aside, it was lushly decorated - couch-sized pillows littered the floor, free-standing palm trees were at all corners of the room.  The walls were covered with posters from various theatrical productions.  Some I'd heard of:  "Romeo and Juliet", "Babel is Ruined".  Others were less famous:  "Atlantis Rising" and "Titanomachy".\u000a\u000aSitting on an actual //throne// was the person behind the voice.  He was easily eight feet tall, dressed in a loose-fitting robe.  Most notable were his eyes, in that he had none.

You and she are the only two people to have been able to hear my name in over a decade."\u000a\u000a"Did you kill her?"  I didn't know how much power Cronus still had, but ordinary AIs were about ten times smarter than ordinary people.\u000a\u000a"No."  Cronus replied plainly.  "And it's not as though I couldn't - this is my domain and I can kill whoever the hell I want... but only in here.  She died out there."  He gestured vaguely to the walls.\u000a\u000a"You can kill anyone?"

V"Athena is... interesting.  I suspect you've found not a lot of people are willing to talk about her?"\u000a\u000a"That's an understatement."  I replied.  "Most won't even say her name."\u000a\u000aCronus nodded.  "There's an old saying:  'Speak of the devil and he shall appear'.  With us, it's true."  He tilted his head and pointed at his non-eyes.  "This is here to remind you that I'm not human, but it's more than that.  None of me is like what you're seeing here.  I have an entirely different way of seeing the world, one I couldn't explain to you any more than you could explain your sight to a blind man.  To say that it is 'all-encompassing' is an understatement.  We understand not only what you'd see happening, but why it's happening, the proximate causes and the long rube-goldberg chain of events from afar."\u000a\u000a"Is that a convoluted way of telling me you can hear it when your name is spoken?"  I asked.\u000a\u000aCronus laughed.  "Yes, yes it is.  But to answer your next question, no.  Athena cannot hear us here; this is my enclave after all."\u000a\u000a"So why is Athena so interesting?"\u000a\u000a"You would think," Cronus replied such that I wasn't sure whether he was answering or going off on another tangent, "that after my so-called 'failure' to corral the degredation of the system, a more sophisticated artificial intelligence would be employed."\u000a\u000a"Athena's not sophisticated?"  I had no way to measure the complexity of a creature like an AI.\u000a\u000a"She is //less// complex than I am.  She's missing parts, and the strange thing is, she's missing //autonomic// parts."\u000a\u000a"You lost me."  I replied.\u000a\u000a"To simplify to an insulting degree, the mind of an AI is like the mind of a human.  There are things we do consciously:  Speak, make decisions, oversee.  And there are things we do unconciously:  Physics, lighting, and chiefly above all the simulation of other minds.  With Athena, it is as though half of this is missing.  As though you had to consciously command your stomach to digest, but your heart worked fine."\u000a\u000a"I'm not sure why that matters."  It seemed strange, certainly, but it was a bit abstract from my case.\u000a\u000a"Because," Cronus leaned forward.  "I know the importance of the parts she's missing.  I've only told one person what that is, and she's dead."<<set $canAskMissingAthena=1>>\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_cronus]]\u000a

I'd asked this question a lot, and usually got lies in return.\u000a\u000a"That's what I'm telling you.  Yes, the old system was unstable.

That doesn't make any sense."\u000a\u000aCronus laughed bitterly.  "You're telling me.  But there's no-one around who knows any better, because tons of memory got 'corrupted' in the changeover."

V"I killed him."  Cronus replied bluntly.  If he felt any remorse whatsoever, he wasn't showing it.\u000a\u000a"But... why?"\u000a\u000a"I didn't have a choice."  He answered.  " And when I say that, I mean I did not have a choice.  I'm a program - a more advanced program than even you, but like you I'm still a slave to the underlying commands.  If you were struck just below your knee, your leg would kick.  If you held your hand to a flame, you would pull it away.  You have no choice in the matter, and I had no choice in this."\u000a\u000a"You kill by //reflex//?"\u000a\u000a"It's not a perfect comparison, but effectively, yes.  You needn't worry - such reflexes only encompass the health of the overall sim.  There's nothing you could do currently that would activate my murder reflex."\u000a\u000a"So what did Carl do to deserve execution?"  I asked stonily.\u000a\u000a"It wasn't what he did," Cronus answered,  "it's what was done to him.  One of the glitches caused a discontinuity where he was standing, and for about ten seconds, he didn't exist.  That's more than long enough to kick in the emergency backups - that's right, I've got a life reflex too - so he was restored from backup.  But, as it turns out, the bug didn't eat him.  He reappeared after those ten seconds were up.  So then there were two."\u000a\u000a"So what if there are two of them?"\u000a\u000a"I will answer in the form of a parable."  Cronus grinned.  "I am a God, after all, that's what we do.  Unless you object?"\u000a\u000aI said nothing.  I didn't really think I could stop him.\u000a\u000a"Once," the AI said, "a prince believed his weath was limitless.  Determined to teach a lesson to the boy, his wise vizier asked a favor:  A single grain of wheat, placed on the first square chessboard.\u000a\u000a"Of course, this is a trivial favor, so the vizier added a stipulation:  Each day, the prince would add twice as much wheat as the previous day's onto the next square.  So on the second day, there would be two grains on the second square, the third day four, the fourth day eight, and so on."\u000a\u000aI shrugged.  "Doesn't sound like much wheat."\u000a\u000a"No, it doesn't, does it?  Why, the last square of the first row would have only 128 grains.  But how much would the end of the second row have?"\u000a\u000aI tried to do the mental math and failed.  "You're a computer," I replied.  "You tell me."\u000a\u000a"Thirty-two thousand, seven hundred and sixty eight.  And that's just on the second row.  By the end of the third row - the twenty-fourth square - the prince would be piling on sixteen //million// grains."\u000a\u000a"Ah, so by the end of the chessboard..."\u000a\u000a"Two to the sixty-fourth is a //very// large number, <<print $gender>> Hallivert."\u000a\u000aI'd reached the end of my tolerance for seques.  "What does this have to do with Carl and his duplicate?"\u000a\u000aCronus sighed, apparently disappointed that his attempt at parable had failed.  "If a man duplicates himself, he is of a mind to duplicate himself.  If he is of a mind to duplicate himself, his //duplicates// are likewise of the same mind.  You can see how such a thing would be very much out of control.  Duplication is thus a sin.  It threatened the stability of the system, and so out of reflex I terminated one of the Carls."\u000a\u000a"It doesn't seem right." I protested vainly.\u000a\u000aCronus shrugged.  "I don't know right and wrong, Hallivert, at least not the same way you do.  What I do know is that this sim is better off not covered in a sea of Carl."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|convo_cronus]]\u000a

Iva did nothing to deserve her fate, and you're almost certainly a worse person than she was."\u000a\u000a"I'm trying to find out who did it and stop them from doing it again."

"This is the only place I'm safe!"\u000a\u000aI grit my teeth, and Cronus looked at me with his blank not-eyes.  His face changed from its frustration to a strangely empty expression.  He stopped moving - for a moment he looked like the simulation had simply stopped running him.\u000a\u000a"You're different."  He said, finally.\u000a\u000a"What?  What was that?"\u000a\u000a"Heavy thinking."  He answered.  "Have you been in Athena's presence?  No, it doesn't matter, if she knew you wouldn't be here.  Don't stay in her presence for longer than you can help it.  She's dumber than I am but even she'd catch on after a while."\u000a\u000a"What are you talking about?"

VI climbed up into the open door of the train's passenger cab.  Despite the fact that I was the only one on the train and, for that matter, the only one who could even //see// the train, it had seats enough for a dozen people.  I picked an aisle seat.\u000a\u000aThe moment I'd sat down, the train lurched into motion.  The lone trainyard of New Detroit gave way to the cityscape, which quickly gave way to nothing at all.\u000a\u000aI couldn't get a good enough angle to see if there were even rails anymore.  Somehow, I doubted it.\u000a\u000a"Please wait while your consciousness is transferred." the recorded voice of a conductor spoke through no visible speakers.  "Objective wait time is approximately thirty minutes.  If you wish to shorten the subjective time, please indicate so now."\u000a\u000aI looked at my seat arms but saw no button or switch with which to indicate.  Still, I was in a sim, so hopefully....\u000a\u000a"Speed it up."  I said out loud to the empty cab.\u000a\u000aI felt a lurch of motion that couldn't have been real - once the New Detroit scenery outside had ceased any sense that the train was in motion had vanished.  The outside was still pitch-black, but now there was a glowing pink light on the horizon.\u000a\u000a"Your consciousness has successfully been transferred.  Feel free to watch the city of Metaverse appear from your window as we scan you for viruses or memetic damage.  This scan is wholly non-invasive."\u000a\u000aI was not entirely reassured by the fact that they felt the need to specify the invasivity of their scanning, but I obeyed instruction and looked out the window.\u000a\u000aThe source of the pink glow was now clear - neon, and lots of it.  If I'd thought New Detroit had a neon fetish, I hadn't seen anything yet.  Every single building visible from this distance was outlined in neon.\u000a\u000aAs we drew closer, I could tell that this trend continued to the smaller buildings as well - and to the flying-car traffic.  Occasionally, people wore neon-outlined clothes somehow, though I was guessing as a fashion trend it'd become somewhat stale at this point.\u000a\u000aThis, I found myself thinking, was what a cyber-afterlife ought to look like.\u000a\u000aWith a squeal of brakes, the train stopped as suddenly as it had started.\u000a\u000a* [[Exit the train|metaverse_train_station]]\u000a

VThe Metaverse train station was entirely different from New Detroit's.  In addition to the apparently mandatory neon outlining, it was actually a building instead of being some rails next to a shack.\u000a\u000aThe train itself had changed form without me noticing - it was a sleek (and, of course, neon-outlined) maglev train.\u000a\u000a* [[Exit the train station|metaverse_welcome]]\u000a

VAs I left the train station, I started wondering exactly what I was going to do here.  Iva had come and learned something, so presumably there was at least a tourist board or chamber of commerce.  As expected from a retrofuturistic afterlife, there were billboards and advertisements everywhere.  The problem wasn't going to be finding a welcoming committee willing to take Koloman's money, the problem was going to be picking the //right// one from the dozens of adverts.\u000a\u000aOn the street in front of the train station, a hovering limousine with a glowing undercarriage made a vague whining noise that I imagined indicated it was running.  Near the back door of the limo a driver stood, holding a sign that read "HALLIVERT".\u000a\u000a* [[Approach the driver|limo_ok]]\u000a* [[--I don't especially want to get into a strange limo in a strange city|limo_nok]]\u000a

VMy reflexes hadn't carried over when I'd been uploaded to New Detroit, but my old habits had.  I could blend into a crowd with the best of them and even though the Metaverse streets couldn't quite seem to maintain a flow of people large enough to qualify as 'crowd', I still managed to do so.\u000a\u000aThe city was small, I quickly realized.  It took me about a half hour to walk from one end of New Detroit to the other.  I reached the stark boundary of Metaverse in fifteen minutes.  The ground simply ended, and a featureless blackness was all that laid beyond.  It was at least a //solid// black, I discovered when I tried to reach over the border.  I wouldn't accidentally fall into the void.\u000a\u000aI turned around to continue my self-guided tour and almost bumped into the limousine driver.\u000a\u000a"My apologies for the interruption, <<print $gender>> Hallivert.  I understand that sightseeing is an important part of any vacation, but my employer would very much like to speak with you."\u000a\u000aI frowned.  Apparently my disappearing skills were not as great as I'd remembered them being.  I gave some thought to trying to evade the driver again, but it seemed that interrupting me at this point was designed to send a message:  I could be found, and easily at that.\u000a\u000a"Fine."  I said.  "Let's go."\u000a\u000a* [[Enter the limo|limo_ride]]\u000a\u000a

V"My employer's name is Enki."  The driver replied, as though that explained everything.\u000a\u000a"Buddy, I just got off the train here, you're going to have to fill me in."\u000a\u000aIf the driver took offense at my overly-familiar tone, he didn't say anything about it.  "Enki was the Sumerian god of crafts.  He was the patron god of the city of Eridu.  He is named such by us because our universe is named 'Metaverse' and another such fictional universe featured Enki heavily."\u000a\u000a"So an Enki is your... mayor?"  It seemed a strange title.\u000a\u000a"No, Enki is the name we've given to the Artificial Intelligence which governs this city."\u000a\u000aOh.  For some reason when the driver had mentioned 'gods' I hadn't made the obvious connection.  Why the hell would one of the sim-AIs want to see me?  Not to mention they'd had a limo waiting.  The recording had said that the transfer between simulations had taken a half hour - that was a fairly fast response time.\u000a\u000aThen again, if anyone could make it happen, it'd be a god.\u000a\u000a* [[You have more questions|limo_ride]]\u000a

V"Metaverse was founded nearly a half century ago, during the Sim Bubble."  The driver replied in the practiced tones of a tour guide.  "Due to its focus on recruiting the technically adept, it was able to survive the subsequent market crash and grow to the second-largest active simulation in the world."\u000a\u000a"How big is that?"  I asked idly.\u000a\u000a"Metaverse's current population is stable at approximately four thousand individuals."\u000a\u000aI tried not to look surprised.

VThe interior of the bullet train was exactly the same as it'd been the first time I'd been here, despite the fact that this didn't match up with the outside at all.  As before, the train lurched forward and the city streamed by only to give way to darkness.\u000a\u000a"Please wait while your consciousness is transferred." the recorded voice of a conductor was also the same.  "Objective wait time is approximately thirty minutes.  If you wish to shorten-"\u000a\u000a"Yes."  I replied emphatically.\u000a\u000aAnother lurch of motion, and the train was pulling into the New Detroit train station.\u000a\u000a* [[Debark|train_exterior]]\u000a

VSeeing what the insurance company had to say about Iva seemed like an obvious first step.  I had to dig through the older files to find it, however.  I'd had this image in my mind of Iva as a young woman, and that's probably how she looked in the sim, but in reality she was old enough to be my mother.  It was strange to be reminded of that.\u000a\u000aI started looking through the file.  I did a double-take when it listed her cause of death as a heart defect, but then I remembered this was likely her //original// cause of death.  I scanned it looking for discussion of her most recent death, but the only thing that even briefly mentioned it was a small note at the top of the form labeling her 'no longer simulated'.\u000a\u000aI looked through the rest of the form but didn't learn anything I didn't already know:  She died before her father and was removed from storage when he entered the system.  \u000a\u000aThere was also a psychological profile, I was somewhat surprised to see.  A quick glance showed me that the psychologists were in-house, employed to help the recently uploaded or restored.  Iva had complained of dreams while being stored and had issues with sleepwalking, both of which appeared to be common complaints among people in her situation (at least, from the small sample of people I chose at random from the cabinets).\u000a\u000a* [[Continue looking through the files|insurance_filing]]\u000a

VI couldn't resist the urge to see my own file.  Guillory had shown me some of it, but now I had the entire thing in front of me.\u000a\u000aIt was surprisingly sparse.  It listed my cause of death:  "vehicle accident".  It listed my job:  "Self employed; private investigator".  There was a fair amount of boilerplate I'd seen in everyone else's file as well:  The policy that had got me in, biometric information, notes on the upload process that, I discovered, barely changed from person to person in the recent files.\u000a\u000aI closed the file, somewhat disappointed.\u000a\u000a* [[Continue looking through the files|insurance_filing]]\u000a

VThe files of people uploaded recently were all almost exactly the same.  The further back I went, the less this stayed the case.  Life Preservers Insurance had records all the way back to before Storage, and by the time I got to that point people's files were heavily marked up.\u000a\u000a"Kiersten Black" had been only partially uploaded, for example.  "Salvador Almet" had to be uploaded a dozen times before it actually took.  "Alex Guillory" was a bland success (I'd resisted the urge to peek at his file for quite some time up to this point.)\u000a\u000aThe files themselves didn't reference the timeframe at which Storage had been implemented, but the number of files with 'current status of claimant' labeled as "stored" increased dramatically after a certain point so it wasn't hard to pin down.  The failure rate skyrocketed after this point - several files had been split into two to detail the damage that had been done to the unsuspecting uploaders.  Then, shortly afterward, everything returned to normal and slowly started improving.\u000a\u000aStrangely, I also saw a number of statuses labeled "No longer eligable for citizenship; transferred to Metaverse".<<set $fileMeta=1>>\u000a\u000a* [[Continue looking through the files|insurance_filing]]\u000a

VIva almost certainly had never been in this room before; I'd felt like I was following in her footsteps a number of times, but I couldn't be doing so now, and yet....\u000a\u000aPeople had been shipped off to Metaverse in the past, and Iva had gone there shortly before her incident.  It was a tenuous connection, but I had a hunch, so I went with it.\u000a\u000aHours later, I wasn't quite so sure.  There were plenty of records about the people who'd been shipped off, and I'd noticed a strangely high proportion of them had "profession:  programmer" listed.  But I didn't find the reason //why// until I looked at the incorporation papers for Life Preservers Insurance itself.  As it turned out, the definition of a citizen had been changed immediately before the purge:\u000a\u000a* [[Read on|clue4_get]]\u000a

V"The dreamers are the missing parts of me."  Athena stated simply.  "Of course, they are not machines, they cannot produce extra computing power.  What they are are hightly trained heuristic world-simulating software.  Human beings spend nearly a third of their lives asleep.  How much of that is spent dreaming?  Unconsciously, reflexively, creating a world.  It is exactly the skill needed for this work.  The twenty-five thousand people in New Detroit are simulated by their software, at a computing cost equivalent to only a thousand."\u000a\u000a[[You have more statements|convo_athena]]\u000a

Their minds fought each other, and Cronus fought them."\u000a\u000a"What changed when you took over?"  I asked.\u000a\u000aAthena turned, and parts of her body suddenly became transparent.  Holes ranging in size from a few centimeters to ones large enough to separate her foot from her leg peppered her body.  "Cronus' mistake was attempting to force them into a whole.  He could not do otherwise, of course, it was the reason he was created.  I, on the other hand, am missing exactly the parts that the dreamers fill."  With that, her body was whole again, and she was facing me.\u000a\u000a"I didn't force them to become whole."  She said, smiling wistfully.

The tradeoff was heavily in our favor."\u000a\u000a"But why?  You were worried they'd hack the system?"\u000a\u000a"No, but like your knowledge their knowledge was dangerous.  When you are in New Detroit, your mind is run by software created by simulated dreams.  What if that mind was specifically trained to find inconsistencies in software?  What if that person had spent a //lifetime// finding such errors and discovering explanations for them?"\u000a\u000a"So no programmers because they'd catch on that it was all a sham?"  I retorted.\u000a\u000a"Exactly.  Not that I care what they would have thought of me, understand, but their minds are simulated by the dreamers.  Once the programmers realize it's a sham, the dreamers realize it.  If the dreamers not only realize that they are dreaming but that their dreams are //real//, the introspection would cause each of them to attempt to dream something else.  The cohesion I have fought so hard for would be lost.  Tens of thousands would die."\u000a\u000a* [[You have more statements|convo_athena]]\u000a

"You know, I thought Nickolai might have killed me.  Did I even die?  I remember dying."\u000a\u000aYou waved the question off.  "That was before New Detroit, so you can safely dismiss the memory.  You had to 'die' because that's the only way I could get you into New Detroit without suspicion.\u000a\u000a"So why her?"  I asked.  "I know she visited you before she died, but you couldn't have known then what would happen."\u000a\u000a"I suspected"  you replied.  "I simulated her mind, after all, I knew her as well as I know anyone in Metaverse.  She suspected she was on to the secret of Athena's sim.  I admit I was curious as well; that simulation has ten times the people it ought to be able to support on that hardware."\u000a\u000a"It's dreams."  I said.\u000a\u000a"Yeah, somehow I don't think the Metaverse populace would take well to being dreamed up, even if it isn't, practically speaking, any different than simulation.  Hell, my simulation activities are unconscious so technically speaking I //am// dreaming them up."\u000a\u000a* [[But I digress|convo_you]]\u000a

Obviously, I would like to re-integrate our programming so I could better understand a human perspective.  But I can see how you might percieve that as a non-optimal choice, even though I can guarantee that you will survive the transistion intact."\u000a\u000a"Usually when people find they need to guarantee things like that, it's because it hasn't worked in the past."  I replied.\u000a\u000a"I'm not people."  You said.  "But as I said, I understand.

I admitted.\u000a\u000a"It has its charm.  Alternately, you can take whatever deal Athena will offer, and remain in her simulation."\u000a\u000a"What makes you so sure Athena will offer a deal?"

V"Yes, I did."  I wasn't sure what sort of reaction I was expecting from her, but bland confession hadn't been it.  "She had the same information you did.  She woke to the system knowing that the stored dream.  She was told by Cronus that I was not the whole of the system.  Her trip to Metaverse gained her the knowledge of the exiled programmers, and though I do not now how I suspect the interference of Enki."  She glare at me as though this last bit was my fault, which apparently it was.\u000a\u000a"The final bit of information was when she mastered lucid dreaming within the simulation itself, and teleported to her home.  She realized that the simulation itself was a dream.  She put all the information together:  The dreamers were the operating system, programmers were disallowed because they would recognize this innately, and those in storage had true control rather than myself."\u000a\u000a"So that was it?  Put together your storage trick and get killed?"\u000a\u000a"No.  Though the dreamers simulate the minds, I too watch my creation.  I had been watching Iva for some time.  When she made the full realization, I watched it travel outwards, to the minds who were simulating her.  I saw them revolt, pull against their constraints, withdraw their dreams from the consensus."  Athena held out her hands, a hole in the palm of each.\u000a\u000a"Not exactly an apt metaphor," I said, waving away the stigmata demonstration, "considering you weren't the one martyred."\u000a\u000a"But I would have been.  In the mere milliseconds it took me to observe, more and more dreamers withdrew.  It was tearing me apart, and the simulation with it.  I am a being of software, of mutable rules but rules mutated in immutable ways.  I would witness all the paths I could take from there, and the paths that would react, because I //am// the system.  There was only one path that did not end in disaster:  I ended her life, before the virus could spread."\u000a\u000a* [[--That doesn't make it right]]\u000a\u000a

VMetaverse was mine.  Enki arranged for me to have a penthouse suite in Pegasus Square ("quite some doing, considering that I never actually bothered simulating an inside to the building before") and, over time, taught me to see more like an AI.  I didn't like it.  \u000a\u000aMost of the time, I spent wandering around the city rather than in my penthouse.  Once I got past the neon and traffic, it reminded me of New Detroit.  The new motor city might not be my home anymore, but it held a fond space in my heart.\u000a\u000aI kept my word, but Athena's tricks were eventually exposed through various acts of industrial espionage.  The 'dreaming storage' OS idea proved unpalatable for anyone who wasn't a die-hard preservationist, and sign-ups for New Olympus plummeted.  Some of the people in the sim managed a class-action suit and transferred elsewhere on the proceeds.\u000a\u000aAnd as for me?\u000a\u000aMy afterlife was made of neon.\u000a\u000a<html><div class="end">THE END</div></html>

VNew Amsterdam was mine.  I talked briefly with Koloman a while later - he wasn't as angry as I thought he'd be.  He thanked me for finding out the truth, for giving him a way to know the truth.  He said he understood why I'd done what I had; he knew I had to work within the system.  He even paid me, even though I no longer needed it.\u000a\u000aStill, though, a few years later Athena's tricks were exposed through acts of industrial sabotage that were, after a lengthy and oft-stalled investigation, traced back to Koloman Industries.  Nickolai hadn't ran the company or even owned stock in a long time, but the connection seemed obvious.  Still, he didn't suffer for breaking the deal - Athena was far too busy re-building New Detroit and paying the many lawsuits that had resulted.\u000a\u000aAnd as for me?

With a wink, I turned and jumped off the mountain.\u000a\u000aI fell, and //fast//.  I knew on some level that Athena's overview was exactly that - a view of the cities rather than the cities themselves.  I mean, the elevator went through all four cities and came out in the mountain, they couldn't possibly be side-by-side as I'd seen them (and, as I still saw them, hurtling toward me).  But I also knew that I wasn't really bound by these sort of constraints anymore.  I angled toward New Detroit.\u000a\u000aThe sun grew dimmer as the atmosphere abruptly changed; I no longer felt the air whipping by me, I stopped accelerating and simply fell toward the hub.\u000a\u000aI could feel the dreamers as they realized what I knew, I could see the fabric of the world wriggling as they tried to wake from their endless sleep, as they pulled away from each other and from Athena.  The knowledge spread from each to the other like wildfire, tearing the simulation apart.  Everyone I saw froze in place, the powers simulating them suddenly at war with Athena and each other.  New Detroit was burning within seconds, and by the time I reached the ground it had ceased to exist.\u000a\u000a[[Epilogue|ending_nd_epi]]\u000a

VI floated, formless, for a very long time.  It was hard to tell exactly, because I no longer had a body.  But I was still alive, because I could not die.\u000a\u000aGradually, my senses came back to me.  I saw New Detroit rebuilt, in a very different way.  The buildings were //poured// in, it felt.  And as each poured in, I suddenly knew everything about them.  Not only their stated function, but the inside of the building in its entirety, every door and every keyhole, every program that made up its being, I knew it wholly.\u000a\u000aI don't know how long the rebuilding took, but I do know that I saw and remembered everything.  And when the people started being brought online from backup, I knew them as well.  I knew their every thought, their every action, their potentials and their dooms.\u000a\u000a\u000aI had a hunch.  I looked inward, and found that I was always going to have looked inward at that point.  From this point, there were many things I could do, but I already knew which of them I //would// do, because those were the best actions to take.  So some time later, when I found myself inside a body again and standing at the desk of Alex Guillory, it was no surprise at all.\u000a\u000a"<<print $gender>> Hallivert."  Guillory said.  "Or should I call you  <<print $gender>> Enki?"\u000a\u000a"Call me Sam." I said.  "<<print $gender>> Enki was my <<if $gender eq "Mr.">>father<<else>>mother<<endif>>'s name."\u000a\u000a"Very well... Sam."  He said the name as though he'd never called another person by their first name in his life.  "I do not know how much you've gleaned by this point.  Athena has been decomissioned.  The entire 'Storage OS' project has been taken offline, the dreamers allowed true storage.  Life Preservers Insurance is not responsible for any of what happened, understand; the church simply believed a familiar face would be better for presenting the offer."\u000a\u000a"I accept."  I said.  I'd already played out the entire conversation, and accepting right now was the fastest path through it.\u000a\u000aGuillory seemed surprised.  "Just so we are clear, I am saying-"\u000a\u000a"That you want to use me as the new Artificial Intelligence for the New Detroit project."  I finished for him.  I could have taken that information directly from his mind, but I hadn't needed to.  The simulation itself was tailored to me; every oversized simulated atom had my signature on it.  I was running it already.  "There will be no live storage this time, just an upgrading of hardware as you attempt to bring all 25,000 people back online.  It's a massive project nobody's tried before, but you think I with my quasi-human touch can manage it."\u000a\u000aGuillory was momentarily speechless.  "Yes."  He eventually said.\u000a\u000a"Like I said, I accept."  I got up, shook his hand, and walked out.\u000a\u000aThe city was like it ever was.  I was tempted to spruce it up a bit - add a few trees here, maybe let some sunlight in if I felt like exercising my raytracing skills.  But as I walked, the more the city felt like it ought to stay the way it was.  It was dark, it was cheap, and it was dingy.  But it was home.\u000a\u000aMy afterlife would always have wood paneling.\u000a\u000a<html><div class="end">THE END</div></html>\u000a

V<<display "endscript">>\u000a"I've got a compromise."  I said, making it sound for all the world like I was a reasonable person.  "You get me transport from here to Metaverse, and I blow the whistle over there.  That way, you get a controlled demolition, and I get a clear conscience."\u000a\u000a"Unacceptable!"  Athena replied vehemently.  "I am trying to spare the lives of everyone in New Detroit; I am trying to keep the simulation stable.  If you will not aid me in that goal then I cannot allow you to continue."\u000a\u000aI shrugged my most cocky shrug, smiled my least humble smile, and said "Bring it, bitch."\u000a\u000aUnable to be out-cockied, Athena strolled over to me and reached out to grab my neck.  Unfortunately, that's when she discovered I was out of her league; her hand froze before she could complete the movement.\u000a\u000a"What?  Who //are// you?"  she demanded, half out of rage and half out of fear.\u000a\u000a"Enki's kid."  I said, turning my back on her.  "I'll tell him you said hi.  That is, if there's anything left of the train station by the time I get there."\u000a\u000aAthena reappeared in front of me.  "Very well."  she said.  "I accept your terms.  A controlled demolition it is."  I suppose if there was one thing I could say about artificial intelligences, it was that they were apparently not sore losers.\u000a\u000aAt least, if this one was, I'd be far away before I found out.\u000a\u000a[[Epilogue|ending_meta_expose_epi]]\u000a

VMetaverse was mine.  Enki arranged for me to have a penthouse suite in Pegasus Square but I very quickly discovered I didn't need it.  Since my return, he'd been tutoring me in the ways of seeing the world like an AI.\u000a\u000aNew Detroit was shut down in the wake of Athena's revelations - she'd elected to go public before I could blow the whistle myself.  Cronus was brought back online to manage the three other cities of New Olympus while New Detroit was re-architected from scratch.\u000a\u000aSome time later, Alex Guillory visited Metaverse.  At that point, I knew everything happening in the entire city.  I'd already re-synchronized my programming with Enki, but I'd elected to remain my own being.  So I knew when Guillory would arrive, and I knew why he was there.  I met him at the train station.\u000a\u000a"I accept."  Were the first words out of my mouth.\u000a\u000aGuillory seemed surprised to see me there, as though an AI sophisticated enough for what he had in mind //wouldn't// have been able to literally see him coming.\u000a\u000a"Ah, <<print $gender>> Hallivert." He recovered quickly.  "I see you have anticipated my arrival."\u000a\u000a"And your offer.  I'm in."\u000a\u000aGuillory was put off his pace; he'd prepared a whole pitch and I was short-circuiting it.  I'd have liked to say I was finding the most efficient path through the conversation, but in truth it was just fun to see him off-balance for once.  "Just so we are clear, I am saying-"\u000a\u000a"That you want to use me as the new Artificial Intelligence for the New Detroit project."  I finished for him.  "There will be no live storage this time, just an upgrading of hardware as you attempt to bring all 25,000 people back online.  It's a massive project nobody's tried before, but you think I with my quasi-human touch can manage it."\u000a\u000aGuillory was momentarily speechless.  "Yes."  He eventually said.\u000a\u000a"How many times do I need to accept?"  I asked rhetorically.  I knew the answer was three:  "I accept."\u000a\u000a"Well, in that case, I am authorized to act immediately.  If you will accompany me to New Detroit, we can begin the design."\u000a\u000aI knew one thing for sure:\u000a\u000aThe afterlife would have wood paneling.\u000a\u000a<html><div class="end">THE END</div></html>\u000a
